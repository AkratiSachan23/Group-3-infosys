## Hate Speech Detection on the Reddit platform

### Description

With the rise of social media, people have the liberty to express themselves, many users misuse this liberty and we can see abuse, offense, and hate spread all across social media platforms, in the form of comments, blogs, etc. The project aims to create a deep-learning model to automatically detect and classify hate speech in text, promoting healthy interactions on Reddit.
