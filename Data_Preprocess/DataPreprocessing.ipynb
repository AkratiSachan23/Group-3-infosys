It may seem unfair to some (for some retarded reason), but I'd personally love for the presumption of innocence to still be a thing the day I'm accused of doing something I didn't do. I'm not saying he did or didn't do it, I'm saying that we presume people innocent for a god damn fucking reason.  Now the fact that he lied multiple times in front of the Senate and read a speech that could seriously have been written by a 5th grader was pretty fucking repulsive and for that reason alone the GOP should have ditched him. And why did he lie? To a avoid embarassment. I don't want somebody like that on the highest court in the country. He had already embarassed himself at that point anyways with his half-retarded speech.\n",

Can we please give him the same presumption of innocence anyone should get until he's actually proven guilty?   According to his detractors, it was just a 'job interview', so innocent until proven guilty doesn't apply.  Most job interviews don't care about accusations that you were a criminal decades ago, or require testimony under oath.  Needless to say, they don't explain what standard they are using, unless you count the \"if it's *possible* he did it, he shouldn't be SCOTUS\" folks.  >He had already embarassed himself at that point anyways with his half-retarded speech.  You mean the speech he made when he was upset for obvious reasons, including death threats against his family, that are not remotely what his job as SCOTUS will be like?\n",

      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\t> \"What is a devils triangle?\" He's a judge willing to lie under oath about petty bullshit.  Because he couldn't get things from decades ago wrong. If it's so petty, why do you want his head over it?  >Moving goalposts? This is a job interview,   How often do job interviews involve people testifying under oath to government officials about crimes someone allegedly committed decades ago? This was a hearing. \"Job interview\" is what people have said when they want an excuse to lower the standard of evidence.  >the goal has always been to establish if he was apropriate for the job.   The goal was to try and get him rejected on an unprovable accusation and maybe stall long enough for the Dems to win enough seats at midterms to block him conventionally. Maybe even to hurt the GOP's midterm chances.  You keep bleating about \"establishing character\" and keep ignoring Ford's actual accusation. Because you're moving the goalposts. You're acting like the way a man acts when he's been accused of rape, yelled at by hundreds of thousands of people, and gotten death threats against his family is how he normally behaves.  >The answer is no for many reasons, not the least of which is his naked partisanship.  Was there a Clinton conspiracy? Almost certainly not. Did the Dems deliberately sit on the accusation for months until it was most inconvenient? Yes, IMO. Even people on the left have criticized this three-ring-circus. And from what I'm told, Kav is actually fairly middle-of-the-road. If he was \"nakedly partisan\", where was the evidence *before* the hearings?\n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t>How often do job interviews involve people testifying under oath  When they are applying for the supreme court, where he lied (which is still a crime) about petty nonsense, yelled about democratic conspiracies and lost his temper while discussing legal issues. Any one of those would be used as a final, unbreakable moral imperative to deny a liberal judge from the court by Republicans. The hypocrisy is overwhelming.\n",

He was a scrawny man, tall and lanky. Fine black hair and the like, and the traditional evil goatee, And yes, he did stroke it occasionally.  Well, It all started when the party went to a little farming village who's average IQ was likely on par with a jar of mayo... On the way out, my Lawyer had a brilliant idea to get some money... The only shop in town is essentially a pawn shop, so I go out to the fields and pick up a few rocks... I cast Light on them... And bring them back to the shop as \"Health Stones, As long as you carry one, you'll never grow ill! Look at how they glow!\" The moron gobbled it up because the town didn't know I was a spell-caster of any acclaim.  That was the start of it..  Second major evil act of mine was using my characters extensive expertise in the law to force a Ma & Pa style Inn to sell to him otherwise he was going to have the place seized for owed taxes... He then turned it into a whore-house... And then burned it down for the insurance money.  After that the party Paladin got fed up with my way and challenged me to a duel of blades, I accepted and surrendered quickly.. And then using my insanely high charisma I convince the Paladin that I've changed my evil ways, that I'll give it all up... So, he allows me to buy him a drink... Next thing he knows, he wakes up in a motel room with a dead hooker on the floor, and outlawed narcotics on the nightstand.  I retired the character shortly thereafter, going off the RP reason that he went into hiding to avoid retribution from the Paladin's Order.  Good times.. \n",

Fuck this show, fuck Netflix, fuck your \"diversity\", fuck this cast and fuck right off.\n",
      "2. \tGet a load of this fucking retard... Let me attempt to explain (probably unsuccessfully) to your shit for brains what I mean.  1) I'm sick and tired of idiots disrespecting the source material in the name of \"muh duh-ver-see-tee\" and virtue signaling. Particularly Americunts such as Hollywood. If you want to make your \"diverse utopia\", do it on your own, make up your own story, don't bastardize existing source material. And it's always - *always* - race swap from white to whatever other color and from male to female. Even if it doesn't make *any* sense whatsoever and even if actually completely breaks the established lore which was the case with Idris Elba in The Dark Tower where racism was actually a big plot in the source material and in fact it was what you liberal morons would call \"reverse racism\" of a black person hating a white person for being white.  Another insane example is that batshit absurd bullshit remake they are trying to make of the Lord of the Flies with *all female cast*. In what universe does it make sense (well in your demented NPC brain it probably does) to convert the all male cast to all female cast and not destroy the core and the fundamental idea of the source material?   Well, \"diversifying\" the Witcher cast makes just about the same amount of sense (for people too stupid to breathe like you this means \"none\").  2) The Witcher is essentially the first or at least the most famous story that comes from Eastern Europe and popularizes our Slavic mythology and culture. I am an Eastern European Slav myself. And yes, it may come as a complete surprise to your \"progressive\" shit for brains, but we do have our own culture for about ~1500 years, give or take a few hundred. And let me tell you what hasn't changed for these 15+ centuries. We don't have \"diverse\" people. In fact we happen to be some of the whitest motherfuckers in existence, proly only the Scandinavians are whiter. I'm so very sorry it \"hurts\" your Western politically correct \"duh-ver-see-tee\" and \"inclusivity\" bullshit but this is **OUR** culture and if you don't like it you can go fuck yourself, preferably with a rusty fork shoved deep inside your anus. I guess \"all cutlures are equal and beautiful\" except yours, yours is too white, we need to \"diversify\" it a little so we can pat ourselves on the back how \"progressive\" we are so that the western feminists social justice retards don't REEEEEEEEE.  So what, we are not allowed to have our own culture? It's not \"diverse\" and \"inclusive\" enough for you? Well, I'm sorry, but being the \"original slaves\" we didn't have much time to \"diversify\" it so that early 21st century millennial NPCs won't be triggered by our evil demonic \"whiteness\". I'm absolutely sure that you wouldn't mind if we make a reboot of the African Shaka Zulu series and cast Channing Tatum in the role of King Shaka? I'm also absolutely certain that you loved Gods of Egypt and its \"authentic\" cast.  So just like you liberal lunatics love to spew this \"whitewashing\" crap, can I also ask to stop \"darkwashing\" **MY** culture? It's not like Slavic culture is that popular and mainstream in the west. We have this one thing and you just have to fuck it all up because of your \"duh-ver-see-tee\" and \"progressive-ness\".  3) Triss canon hair color is not red, it's chestnut, dumbass. And she is \"best girl\" (you NPCs really can't meme) because I love her character from the books. She is my favorite character in the entire series. So your failed attempt at \"weeb shaming\" doesn't really cut it, it only shows how shallow your shit for brains is and what ignorant moron you are.  Fuck outta here, NPC.\n",

That's entirely inconsistent with Marxists that would not want those boards to exist.  > Terrible comparison. Those two groups existed concurrently.   And, as I noted Marxists/communists still exist, concurrently with the SJW ideologies, and critical theory goes back to the 1930s. It's approaching 100 years old. And it involved leaving Marxism. Thomas Sowell was a Marxist in the 50s, as he has said about himself, however that doesn't make all of his later work Marxism (especially as it involved things like promoting free market capitalism).  Trying to make everything Marxism in an attempt to discredit is the same as trying to make everything the alt-right in an attempt to discredit.

Yes, they pivoted to grievance studies as the next best avenue for attacking Western Civilization aka capitalism. They are useful idiots who would be openly Marxist if it were a viable declaration - and indeed some of them declare it anyways. If the boards are going to exist, they want women on them. And those women should, of course, be feminists. Because feminists will, of course, *operate the boards in a manner antithetical to the boards*.

It's the same as the SJW protocol to avoid actually dealing with positions and arguments and just go ad hominem.  There is clear academic lineage connecting Marxism to progressivism. You cannot say the same for all of the mutually exclusive groups that have been accused of membership in the alt-right. Probably because everyone who opposes Marxism  is \"alt-right\" to a leftist.

I should never have put myself in that situation in the first place — letting someone have a chance to control my universe in that way.

      "16. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo, she did not accuse him of rape; does that make you happy? I don’t know why you’re so passionate about the title being slightly wrong. That’s like calling someone out for saying someone was killed with a shovel when it was really a baseball bat.\n",
      "17. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo, it's like calling out someone was killed with a shovel when it was really beaten but not killed by a baseball bat. They're wildly different levels of accusation.  Am I happy? Well, in my very first post, all I said was that the title was factually incorrect (which you have finally admitted that it actually is) and I got you and your gang of noodle heads attacking me like I had said all men should be castrated. So am I happy? Not really, but if you now go and read my first comment, knowing what you know after having admitted that the title was wrong, ask yourself \"why did I feel attacked by this comment.\"\n",
      "18. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDid I feel attacked? No. Did I feel that your comment was pretty pointless? Better.   And I didn’t “admit” anything, my entire argument is that the inaccuracy of some reddit thread title should have absolutely zero effect on how someone looks at this situation. And that in the *real* world, most people wouldn’t care to make the distinction for this man when they saw his name. Whether you believe it or not, that is what matters in this case. The public eye. And by the way, my shovel analogy accounts for public reaction, which again, is what matters here. People give a shit about the difference between life and death, contrasting to the grouping of all sexual offenses as one prime offense against women or whatever. You may be smart enough to make the distinction, but don’t have faith in everybody else to follow suit.\n",

Sure there are some idiots who believe this shit but let's face it for most of them this is their gravy train.  Emotionally whole, functioning, decent self sufficient people have no need for a snake oil cult- so at best they are useless to them, at worse they can try to *actually* help their converts, which costs them.  While more subtle and societal pressure and manipulation based, do not be fooled- Feminists/modern SJW/NPC Marxists are just the same fucks as Stalin or Mao Zedong If you aren't a useful asset, or out of their way(often this isn't good enough either) you are a problem and they will fucking deal with you.

I’ve investigated dozens of sexual assault allegations and I can remember a handful that were true.  I have absolutely had some true ones and it’s hard to explain, but I can usually tell pretty quickly when those are because the woman acts differently (and not how you’d expect). More so than how they act (I’ve had some [real] sexual assault victims act very quiet, or very sad, or very mad) but mainly their stories make sense.  The false ones that I’ve investigated just don’t make sense and it’s blatantly obvious. The timelines don’t make sense, big plot points change, suspect description changes, or the suspect has definitive proof of the lie.  I’ve commented on a case of mine before where when I talked to the suspect he showed me texts from the night in question from the “victim” saying no one could find out about them hooking up or her boyfriend would hear.  Well the boyfriend heard and when I showed her the texts (from her to “suspect”) she just apologized and got up to leave the room (like that was going to be the end of it). Taking her to jail was very satisfying.   Cops still should have due diligence to investigate all claims like they are true. I have sisters, a mother, and a wife and if some cop blew off a real assault I’d be furious. But IF the report is proven false, that person needs to go to jail. The shitty thing is false reporting is a misdemeanor in my state while sexual assault is felony. \n",

She's afraid of men and she's being honest about it (\"I fear men because I've been given reason to\" is *worlds* away from \"men are garbage and should all be killed\"), is this really grounds to call her out?  Let's be clear, the world may not be the apocalyptic wasteland of roving rape gangs that Tumblr likes to pretend, but it's not all sunshine and roses either. Plenty of women *have* reasons to fear men.  Even if you don't believe that mistreatment or sexism against women ever happens (and that's completely naive), the absolute *minimum* that anyone who's been here for any length of time should recognize is that girls and women are regularly at least *told* that they need to fear men.  And the particular hypocrisy of posts here mocking her for fearing men by pointing out that you, as a man, fear women, is just staggering.  Look, I'm just as concerned about a bogus accusation ruining my life as, apparently, everyone else here. But the least we can acknowledge is that a woman with similar concerns has a point too.\n",

      "3. \t\tI agree that it's not healthy or rational, but it doesn't justify mockery either. Most significantly, for once it's honest rather than hyperbolic hate-filled horseshit. I can empathize with and respect someone who recognizes that an issue they have is ultimately *their* issue (\"I'm afraid\" as opposed to the standard \"you're all terrible monsters\"). She probably can't help having an irrational fear, but her way of handling it is way ahead of Tumblr baseline.\n",
      "4. \t\t\tI think you're taking a too-charitable assumption, that this is a self-aware admission of irrational fear, or at least the budding stages of one, but that's not really reflected in the post. The fact that it begins by deflecting (off-camera) accusations of hatred and ends by shifting any burden to the reader leads me away from that conclusion, not toward it.  I don't think \"I'm afraid\" is enough to encompass and own the whole problem. There's still the matter of what you do with your fear.  In this case, concluding little more than \"[My critics] should learn why\" externalizes the overreach, it doesn't own it. \"I'm afraid even when I don't need to be sometimes\", or \"I'm afraid but I try not to let it affect my relationships\" would be ownership-taking sentiments, and would, I expect, garner respect and sympathy. Fear is a beast, but there are still responsible and irresponsible pet owners.   As far as the mockery goes, it's definitely a stance worthy of criticism. While I can sympathize with fear, and understand that we can't control what brings visceral terror into our hearts (save for not wallowing in horror stories and frightening ourselves), a person still has to employ their higher faculties to manage the bad actions or prejudiced, faulty thinking that fear might move them to, be that an outright veto or at least recognition and mitigation. Going proudly, knowingly forward into prejudice, dragging fear behind as a justification, though, that gets no sympathy.\n",
      "5. \t\t\t\tFair enough, my standards for what represents self-awareness may have been lowered by continuous exposure to the toxic sludge coming out of Tumblr, and I may be overvaluing a glimmer of it in a sea of delusion here.  Still, baby steps. I'd rather be overly charitable to someone who at least shows *some* level of connection to reality than treat them all as faceless members of the same amorphous, despicable bunch (After all, the latter's the kind of mindless tribalism we're here to call out).\n",

They actively want to remove freedom of speech and freedom of movement and freedom of association and freedom of being alive from people simply for being born not white. It’s naive to think that the free marketplace of ideas can defeat these people, because they aren’t actually participating in the marketplace. They’re gaming the marketplace to co-opt it and destroy it. And people are too stupid to notice it happening. It’s obvious that the marketplace of ideas has failed as the violence we see at protests now is a symptom of that failure. I believe that there are ideas that can undermine the entire structure of our country and we must do everything we can to protect ourselves from these ideas. If you think America cannot be defeated by an idea, then you need to understand that America as founded on ideas and defeated Britain with those ideas. The war with radical Islamic terrorists is going to be won with an idea. Fuck man, it’s arguable that the idea of America and the H-bomb is what has kept the world in relative peace since WW2.

Cool  Also , you fucking illiterate dumbasses, the felony is called \"perjury\" and it's the same if a man lies about another man or woman or any other configuration you want. It has nothing to do with rape or about \"women having an advantage\" in the legal system (imagine being so big of an unashamed illiterate, that you actually believe shit like this unironically).   It also varies from state to state , and yes the minimum is typically 1 year, but under a federal case you get up to 5, depending on the intent you had when you committed said perjury,etc.    And even worse, you can also get away with fucking rape with a 1 year sentence. Even if you actually did it. HUH, see i made a scary statement there. It's almost like we have this principle that guides how the justice system punishes people.... HUH  Of course this all depends on what actually happens, and WHERE, and turns out judges actually consider all of this crap when making ruling since they actually more about their field than any of you fucking morons will clearly ever know about literally anything.  And finally, of course, you have the fact that false rape allegations resulting in convictions aren't a widespread issue in the slightest according to just, well, virtually every credible authority on the subject.

      "3. \t\tok?\n",
      "4. \t\tOkay I will bite.  >for lying under oath would get punished the same as a typically very violent, and very physical act,   First off what is being referenced here is not punishment for a violent crime versus an non violent crime. What is being referenced is where no violent crime has taken place and on the word of the accuser a person is sent to jail. So perjury can net a person a long, as in up to a lifetime in jail, where the punishment for perjury when discovered is trivial. No one is arguing that a person should get a light sentence for a violent crime against anyone. Or that the sentences for violent crime and perjury should be the same.  >imagine being so big of an unashamed illiterate, that you actually believe shit like this   Women receive far lighter sentences for the same type of crime as men across the board in all crime categories excluding none. Women caught committing the exact same crime as a man, ie she is a co-defendant, receive lighter sentences than their male co-defendants except in rare instances. The more severe the crime where both male and female defendants of the same crime the women will almost invariably receive years less in sentencing.   >you have the fact that false rape allegations resulting in convictions aren't a widespread issue in the slightest according to just, well, virtually every credible authority on the subject  This statement is incorrect. The number of false rape accusations being detected has greatly increased since the hysteria that the rape culture movement created by feminists highlighted that blindly believing an accuser caused more victims to be created. The whole title 9 fiasco where due process was removed from accused highlights the failing in the mentality.

There were plenty of 'sexually open' communities that pushed for the normalization of fetishes, BDSM being the largest. That community embraced gay people, since \"normies\" shunned them too. As fetishes became more mainstream, so did gay people, and eventually gayness went from being \"kill it with fire\" to \"lol, whatever faggot\".

I’ve seen so many fathers tell their daughters they aren’t allowed to date because “all men want the same thing” or “you’re too good for them”. If you do that, you are teaching this girl that:  1) All men are probably trash. Instead of allowing the daughter to learn how to find a desireable partner, they are shunned and sheltered from all men.  2) It shows the daughter you don’t trust her to make good decisions, that her ability to detect a safe person isn’t valuable.  3) The double standard shows girls that they can’t make their own decisions like their male siblings can. They aren’t able to defend themselves and need a man to protect them.  I am all for protecting your child from terrible people. But, the whole stereotypical protective dad is toxic to young girls in the sense of forming autonomy and independent ability to be comfortable making decisions.   Does that make sense, or did I word it weird? It’s like 4 AM \n",

It is a sub however for pointing out when society finally denies a pussy pass by treating a woman the same way men are treated on a constant basis. If the granting of pussy passes to women wasn't so prevalent and noticed than subs like this wouldn't even exist because a story about a woman going to jail for a crime just wouldn't be interesting.  There are countless subs however just absolutely dedicated to blaming men for everything and anything. Feminism, offmychest, relationships, TwoXChromosomes, and pretty much any default or formerly default sub will readily showcase this anti-men sentiment and overall hate that men have to face constantly. We get blamed for everything, are considered to be the perpetrator instantly(even when we are the actual victim), are looked at as criminals without actually having done anything wrong, get screwed over by the court system constantly, and otherwise have everything going against us while we get to sit here listening to people talk about all of our \"privilege\" and so is it at all surprising that a sub that allows men to vent about the constant situation that is our society is wanted and needed? Is it somehow wrong to allow men to talk about what they see in society or to complain about it? Why is it that when men do complain suddenly it's something that needs to be dealt with or destroyed?

Even if you are left wing I can't see how someone could not think the same, they are doing every single thing they can to undermine the duly elected officials of this government short of direct combat and obviously sent by them assassins. I'm amazed there aren't some of the latter.    So far you just got a few nuts, only one I can think off the top of my head, which while I think they wanted him to do it, no one directly led him to attack republicans, just a matter of scare monger hard enough until one of their more batshit supporters does something. There's no real concrete evidence of that however.  I'm kind of amazed there haven't been a fuckton of assassination attempts on Trump yet, either by professionals, or by lone nuts. If the dems lose hard in the midterms, which I wouldn't be surprised if they do, or at least don't get their \"blue wave\" I wouldn't be surprised if you get more violence one way or another, or if Trump gets elected for another terms.  These people are jumping away from reality at the same speed superman can free himself from this fucking planets gravity.  It's almost funny. I mean fuck Trump isn't really all that conservative. He doesn't really seem to believe in small government shit like most conservatives I have talked to do, he just seems to be trying to bring things to some semblance of sanity. These people act like going back to 1980-1990s policies is like going back to 1880 policies- which probably weren't half as bad as these twats think anyway.\n",

      "4. \t\t\tYou would think they would be masturbating about it in the media.\n",
      "5. \t\t\t\tWhy? Assassination attempts generally increase the favorability of the politician targeted. They also tend to paint the side that did it as crazies, which lowers their favorability. It's the same reason the Bernout guy that volunteered for multiple Senators who shot up Scalise didn't get a lot of publicity. \n",

The professionals would be hired by people for whom killing Trump would be counter-productive. They need to neuter/control him, not martyr him. \n",
      "14. \t\t\tRemember when Trump was giving a campaign speech and a guy jumped onstage and charged at him, then the very next day the media interviewed the guy to get his side of the story? Imagine what the media's reaction would have been if the same thing happened to Clinton. I guarantee they would have called it an assassination attempt\n",

      "18. \t\t\tThat's why their gnashing of teeth would be funny if they weren't so insane about it.  I'm pretty sure it's because they don't have any real dirt on him. They are control freaks and they *can't* control him. Honestly most things I have heard don't really hurt these people unless they are insanely crooked, even then if they aren't trying to fuck with him he'd probably leave them alone just to get done what he feels must be done. He only seems to want to shake things up so far in he needs to, to bring our government out of it's utter insanity.  I wish he'd do more but he was never really that conservative or right wing.\n",
      "19. \t\t\tThat's probably why a lot of us moderate center-left folks don't find him \"deplorable\".  His views are all over the place and it's hard to put him in a \"box\" because he holds these views that don't fit anywhere.  He's an asshole, but he's an effective asshole, and he gets people to react to him, and he knows it.  4D Chess and all that, yet the modern left can't fucking even recognize THAT, they don't want to ADMIT to being manipulated by him.\n",
      "20. \t\tTrump has it's own private security along with the secret service, so he's in good hands.  > >It's almost funny. I mean fuck Trump isn't really all that conservative.

At the same time, he wants to cut Medicare. Either that or he's showing \"mianzi\" to his base and if a real medicare for all bill gets passed (if it does passes), he will prostrate and sign it.\n",

And those that step outside that line are ridiculed and looked down upon, without being given even a modicum of respect that they might be reasonable in their ideas. Instead, they're portrayed as hateful, irrational, or intolerant.

Almost any problematic 'anti social behavior' is also going to be illegal, I don't have a problem with laws being enforced, but evicting someone with vague explanations of 'oh well she was anti-social', is retarded.

It only sounds like bullshit because you have done zero research before forming your opinion.  As for evicting her, that's not a charge against her, that's against the landlord for not doing anything about his shit tenant. It's the exact same as a US landlord getting hit with a \"maintaining a nuisance property\" charge. How would you feel if you had a rental next door with some crazy bitch that yelled and screamed at you all the time. Came banging on your door constantly, spitting and pudding on it.

I think one of the big things is that feminist types want to see only fantasy that makes them feel good about themselves, while me (and I assume a bunch of others) want to experience stories. Flawed characters who hit close to home may not always make you feel good about yourself, but they make you think, they give you more than just the creator trying to flatter the idealised self you imagined for yourself.       Now many of these people say things like \"so you can believe dragons and not muh female/gay/whatever characters??\", but they don't understand that it's different. We need to connect to the characters and honestly, a lot of the time people connect to others because they understand their pain.       My example is Harry Dresden, because I am a huge fan and know my shit. So. Many feminists hate his character. But here is the thing, I connect t him because I am similar. Sure, he is a man, a wizard and detective, I'm a woman, trainee at a dental lab and generally a pussy when it comes to physical danger. But he makes fun of himself, like me, he has this huge sense of justice, like me, he gets in trouble because he can not just bend the knee and spit on his morals, like me.    The pitfalls of this character are similar to my own problems, just amped up and with magic. I could get him. I do not say you all need to be like him or me. But I can feel a sort of fictional companionship.      Not trying to make it sound like I am some brilliant person, I am not. But when I participate in the stories of Harry Dresden I have to look at myself from an outside perspective and I have to acknowledge our shared flaws. It takes some self-awareness which a lot of the more SJW-inclined people don't do, because it makes them uncomfortable.    So lets just take some women's march gender studies girl, with pink hair, who is vegan and freaks out a lot about random first world things. She will not be content with a character like herself, who would probably not be the biggest female warrior, strongest of them all. She wants the allmighty,, flawless heroine and will take any flaw in her as an insult against herself. \n",

If you try to file a complaint against an officer, it is legal for them to trick you into signing a notarized sworn statement, instead of a complaint , which is not a notarized sworn statement.   There are hundreds of videos of people auditing police department complaint processes and posting the legal jargon to illustrate the matters.   They try to trick people into legally binding sworn notarized statements.   Here's one channel's adventures. Philip Turner, the victorious winner of the Turner vs Driver case.   https://www.google.com/search?q=complaint+audit+battousai   Edit: cue some complete idiot imagining I am defending the cunt in the post, using their extreme fantasy dreamwork fiction skills based on hallucinations. \n",

      "3. \t\tLook up the state laws on requirements to file a complaint, and compare that to the literal hundreds of videos where LEO officials tell outright lies to people inquiring about the process.   A sworn statement can be used as a legal document against you in a court of law, and most likely will. That's why there is a legal standard that elected officials felt the need to legislate regarding the complaint process against LEOs. So the LEOs don't retaliate.   I am still calling the lady in the story a cunt who deserves what she gets, BUT, anyone reading who wants to file a legitimate complaint against an LEO, should NEVER , EVER, NOPETHEFUCKOUTOFTHERE, sign a notarized and sworn document to complain against an LEO. There is no possibility that any half sane lawyer in existence would disagree with me.   The cops purposely trick people into signing legal documents, flouting the law. They literally intimidate people out of ever filing anything, with the easy threats that they can arrange for ten officer witnesses to contradict the complainant's document and use it to prosecute them, and the person leaves the station, and forgets about filing anything again, in their life.   Thus the specific legislations in all the states regarding LEO complaint processes that every state felt the dire need to enact into law to make sure people are not badgered into filing legal documents, or intimidated out of complaining.   Why else would they feel the need to waste all of that time and money constructing such legislation?   Once again, fuck the lady in the story, and yay for good and honest cops who do not try and trick people.   Here's an example. California state law.   ''Providing Personal Information.  You do not have to provide the personal information requested. If you  do not wish to provide personal information, such as your name, home address, or home telephone  number, you may remain anonymous.''   https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/civilrights/citizencomplaintpolicy.pdf   Notarized requirements as stated by most police departments in complain audit videos are illegal, but qualified immunity allows them to openly lie about the process at will with zero repercussions.   Watch your ass folks, and IANAL, so talk to the best one you can find if you ever have to complain about an officer.   Fuck the lady in the OP story. \n",

While studies are ongoing, \"The Smack^TM\" is still in clinical trials and not recommended for institutional use at this time.

Queer in the dictionary means strange, bit unusual or weird or odd. This is why gay men gained the slang term queer as they were strange to heterosexuality in times of intolerance. Now through claiming the word, the Queers are strange and unusual compared to their LGBT counterparts as in they themselves don't fit the existing terms. With the constant need to label and name call in this new gatekept community, a queer can't really be a queer for long before they get assigned a new term. For example until Non Binary was a thing you could call them Gender Queer but now Non Binary is why there is an N in the expanded form of LGBT+. \n",

Conversely, some argue that fake child porn could be an outlet that prevents someone else from harming a real child because they can \"safely\" live out a harmful fantasy.  In the same way, an argument could be made that someone who gets off on raping sex robots could be just practicing and then feel emboldened enough to try the real thing.

You can program a sex robot to scream out in pain/terror, cry \"No no no, please top\", try to fight back, etc.  With a sex robot, you could simulate the rape act perfectly, to the point that if you were to film that act then it would be indistinguishable from filming a real rape.  Just like if the sex robot were a child then \"inanimate object\" or not, filming it would be as illegal under existing child porn laws.

Neither science nor law is able to currently draw a line between \"healthy outlet\" and \"practice for the real thing\" and sex robots only blur this line further.  > And there is already rape fantasy porn so who cares if it's not real?

      "2. \tSo a few important things;  > Obstruction is an absolutely bullshit charge.  1) Whenever the police asks you questions, you're expected to cooperate without incriminating yourself. As such, it can be seen as obstruction if you refuse to cooperate, and that is illegal even if we dislike that it is.  > You can't cuff someone because they don't want to give you their name... She refuses to give her name and he follows her going \"That's it you're getting dropped\"  2) Yes, you can. Police has the legitimate mandate to detain people who (actively) interfere with an investigation and/or obstruct that investigation. Does the police need to be as forceful? No.  > It's not a crime to have alcohol in a cooler when none of it is open.  I am not familiar with laws in the US, nor am I a lawyer. But as a reference, in the Netherlands we have something that's called een \"Algemene Plaatselijke Verordening\" or APV. It translates roughly to \"General Local Regulation\". An APV is used to impose additional restrictions on a smaller area, such as not possessing any stimulating materials and/or alcohol within an area of the city. Should such an APV be applied to the beach, it becomes legally enforceable and you can be fined or arrested. I used to work in a football (soccer) stadium as security, and the entire area around the stadium was under an APV that made the possession of alcohol illegal during the days that there were football events within the complex. As a result, anyone who was found with alcohol either in their hand or carrying it, can receive a hefty fine and be denied access to the stadium.  Why is this important? I am sure US law has something akin to that, though I am not clear on the name used. If such a regulation is put into place, ownership of alcohol even if closed and in the cooler would be illegal. Furthermore, by having that alcohol on the beach there is a very high probability that one or more of those alcoholic drinks will be consumed (which would possibly be illegal depending on local rules). No one will bring a cooler with 6 beer in it, and leave it out in the sun to not drink any of them.  > Tackles her, rubs her face in the sand, then starts punching her repeatedly while on top of her?   I do not condone or accept the violence both by and against police officers. Just do not confuse legality of actions with the interpretation of people on how to proceed. Detaining the lady was an appropriate action, **the method in doing so was not.**  Edit:  For the record, under New Jersey statute N.J.S.A. 2C:33-15 it is **illegal** for a minor to **possess** or consume alcohol. Any person not of **legal drinking age** (21 years old) who is caught purchasing alcohol or is in **possession of alcohol in a public place** can be charged with the disorderly person's offense of Under Age Alcohol Possession.\n",
      "3. \t\tYou don't know American laws.   In order to detain someone you need to state that you suspect the individual of a crime, and state that crime exactly.   American's are not obligated to provide their name or ID unless they have committed a crime.   He tackled her for walking away without ever saying \"you are being detained\" without ever saying \"we are holding you for suspicion of underaged possession of alcohol.\"   If he wasn't a violent, power hungry shithead, the police officers and the girl simply could have waited for the Aunt that she had called to return to the beach, she could have claimed the unopened alcohol in question and absolutely zero charges would have been brought.  It is incredibly difficult for a police officer to prove \"possession\" of an unopened alcohol container when there was allegedly an adult present moments ago, and when both girls were stone sober.   Obstruction is something American cops use to force compliance or add additional charges to someone who isn't \"cooperating.\"   Police, specifically NJ police, are notorious for using tactics like that to force compliance, to manipulate people into admitting guilt, to get more information. I have dealt with NJ police literally my entire life. I was born and raised in NJ.  Your alcohol laws are simply different from those in New Jersey. I was born and raised in NJ, I've summered on that beach. The Quad Cops are absolutely notorious for harassing everyone that looks under 25. They are not well received by the community AT ALL. And they are known for being overzealous and aggressive, this was one of many examples.   You don't know what you are talking about.   It is ridiculous that all the way from the Netherlands you're blindly hypothesizing on American laws when you didn't research a single thing.   You're arguing with me that you are more informed about the State Laws that apply to me directly, you probably haven't dealt with an American police officer once in your life. Certainly not one from NJ.\n",
      "4. \t\t\tDid you read what I said?  > I do not condone or accept the violence both by and against police officers. Just do not confuse legality of actions with the interpretation of people on how to proceed. **Detaining the lady was an appropriate action, the method in doing so was not.**  Based on the allegations (possession of alcohol by a minor), the officer had all the rights to detain her while conducting further investigation. Should that aunt come by and verify the story independently then the lady would be released with an apology for the trouble. At least, that would assume that the cops themselves are upstanding people. I do not know them, so I can not judge.  The fact that she was in possession of alcohol, even if she held it for someone else, is already a problem legally. Under New Jersey statute N.J.S.A. 2C:33-15 it is illegal for a minor to possess or consume alcohol. Any person not of legal drinking age (21 years old) who is caught purchasing alcohol or **is in possession of alcohol in a public place** can be charged with the disorderly person's offense of Under Age Alcohol Possession.  It doesn't matter if it belonged to her aunt or not, she was in possession of the alcohol at that moment and therefore in violation of the above law. That these laws are draconic is a very different issue than the one posted here. The lady refused to cooperate with the police, which works against her argument that it is her aunt's alcohol. Why is it so difficult to be polite and cooperate with the police rather than screeching and yelling while obstructing their investigation.  Did the police officers do everything right? Absolutely not. But the procedure applied and the actions committed by the police officers do not absolve this girl from breaking the law on underage possession of alcohol. It does not absolve her from obstructing an investigation by refusing to cooperate with basic questions, especially when she's trying to play the \"OH MY AUNT OWNS THESE\" card.  So before you tell me that I am wrong, perhaps read your laws first.  > It's not a crime to have alcohol in a cooler when none of it is open.  Because this absolutely is when the cooler is in the possession of a minor.\n",

Well, she actually said \"If you're a comedian and only want to make people laugh, then get off the stage, and let somebody use the platform!\"  That's literally the point of being a comedian, to make people laugh.  There's a british comedian I like called Rob Beckett, he was promoting his forthcoming tour, and actually said \"There's nothing about Trump, or Brexit, or any of that political stuff, I'm just letting people get away for a couple of hours, and have fun.\"  It's sad that a comedian has to say \"I'm here to make you laugh\", and other comedians saying \"If you're just trying to make people laugh, you're not doing your job!\"\n",

Maybe it’s theatre or something but if you can’t figure out how to make something funny then don’t call it stand up.  I’m guessing from your username you’re into O and A, I wish Patrice was around now because he’d shred this nonsense.   It’s not even that long ago but can you imagine Tropic Thunder being made today? The outrage at Robert Downy Junior blacking up (even though that’s the point) would be insane.  \n",
      "6. \t\t\t\t\tYeah, It's \"Nanette\".  I keep on meaning to listen to Cum Town, but Nick Mullen hits it on the head, it's not for people like her to say \"If you're a comedian and you only want to make people laugh, then get off the stage!\" well, in response to that, I say, if you're promoting a stand up comedy show, and in turn, you wish to give a Feminst TED Talk, then you should vacate the stage, because I'm there for funny people.  Every single time shit like this comes up, I wish Patrice was around for it.  The amazing thing is, that clip of him making that Feminist look stupid is so relevant today.  Funny you mention Tropic Thunder, you know the guy who made that Apu documentary?  Well, he actually bitched about Tropic Thunder doing that, when asked if he felt the same about White Chicks, he was suspiciously quiet.\n",
      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\tThe Patrice clip seems more relevant as time goes on. The woman who kept on talking about “the nation” speaking is exactly the same type of mentality as the woman saying comedians have to talk about serious topics and that outrage culture that goes along with it.  Imagine if a comic tried to dictate to her and say you shouldn’t talk about x and the hypocritical outrage that would happen over that. Didn’t know about the Apu documentary guy but it’s exactly the same thing. If you have to hold a double standard in a position you take then why should anyone listen? Of course if it’s one rule for you and another rule for everyone else that’s instantly going to mean people dismiss you.   It’s just the hypocrisy that I find baffling. The types who say they hate straight white men and then complain about racism and sexism won’t admit they’re a different side of the same coin. People will call out white separatists and then say that safe spaces that exclude white people are fine. They’re either both equally abhorrent or acceptable or you’re a hypocrite.  Are there any comics you’d recommend listening to at the moment?  I think if you like O and A you’ll like Cum Town/Nick Mullen. There’s not much of his standup around but just chatting shit on a podcast there aren’t many funnier people I’ve heard. Recommend Kurt Metzger and Million Dollar Extreme too. Metzger did Race Wars podcast with Sherrod Small but I find the guy insufferable to listen to. For silly laughs I like Nate Bargatze too. There’s lots of comedy albums on Spotify which I’ve only recently discovered were on there \n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tYeah, the term she used that always stuck with me was that Opie & Anthony had \"Violent images towards women\"... it's a radio show.  I remember that Bearing video where he talked about Hannah Gadsby, and there was the part where a guy was at her show and said \"Are there gonna be any jokes in this?\", and she got security to kick him out, saying \"I don't want you here, I'll donate your ticket money to a women's shelter\".  It's a perfectly valid thing to ask, you think you're going to a stand up comedy show, and instead you're greeted with what is essentially that \"play\" in Friends where the woman scream \"Why don't you like me?!\"  As for the comics, I'm British, and none really match up to the \"O&A\" vibe, but maybe give Steve Hughes a try, he did an amazing Anti-PC bit a few years ago.  But a lot of our comics are very safe, but can be funny.  I'm really enjoying Gregg Davies (who, ironically enough is in The Inbetweeners).  But, I've enjoyed:  - Gregg Davies - Sean Lock - Rob Beckett - John Bishop - Jason Manford - Mick Ferry - Mickey Flanaghan  But, like I said you might not like them, because, right now, the british comedy scene seems to be very safe, very \"Only these people are allowed to be targetted\".  I love that you brought up Sherrod, that \"Dassabesso\" clip will always be funny.\n",

If you fucking up a kids life, you deserve for yours to be just as fucked up if not more.  > how rare a sentence is like that/ how often similar offenders get slaps on the wrist.

      "5. \t\t\t\tI think the biggest shocker is the “without chance of parole” aspect and the fact that most pedos don’t get nearly that long of a sentence. 11 is extremely young and much more rapey than a 16/17 year old male who might be actively pursuing sex anyway. Just nuts. She’ll be 50...60...70...80...90 and still in jail with 0 chance of getting out. But hey, she raped a child repeatedly. Murderers don’t even get that long. Especially overseas but Texas doesnt fuck around. Rekt. \n",

I find tracking thr legendary animals much more fun because there's no way to fuck up the pelt quality. You can just dumb as many shotgun shells as you like in the cunt and the pelt will be just top tits.   Standard hunting? You gotta find the animal. Then study it. If it's skinny or sick or too young, no matter how well you do it'll give you a shitty pelt so don't bother, find another that's healthy and old enough.   Then you've gotta shoot it, once, with the right arrow, and make sure the first shot is either an instant kill of a near-to-instant kill, because if you shoot it so it won't die straight away you'll fuck up the quality of the pelt or worse, it'll run so far before it dies you'll lose it in the chase. Then you'll get a perfect pelt.  Then you got to finish hunting, and get to town quick enough that rot doesn't set in t the carcass (because selling the carcass is what you really want, fuck donating to the camp, I'll just pay for camp upgrades out of my own pocket. The camp upgrades are useful don't get me wrong, I'd say donate until you have the right value to upgrade Dutch's tent, then only donate the bare minimum to the NPCs don't bother you. Only donate pelts you need for crafting.) if you don't sell it quick enough it'll rot and the value will be harmed.   Fuck it, do the fake fisherman trick. To get provisions in your camp just buy the meat from a fucking butcher.   Now I know that sounds like fun to some people, and there's days I'm in the mood for that shit, too. But if it doesn't sound like your kind of thing? You can functionally ignore the hunting mostly. Just shoot birds out of the air every now and then so you can make arrows, because that's kind of your only silent weapon you can carry a lot of ammo for. At least as early in the game and I am.   Fishing on the other hand? **Fuck me** this game had good fishing. And just like hunting legendary animals, there's legendary fish to catch.   The first chapter *is* boring as fuck. As soon as the game tells you it's Chapter 2, the instant you park wagon in the second camp, the game finally opens up and becomes a good game. That's about an hour or 2 in. \n",

See, the black text rockstar tutorial boxes (rockstar always had shit tutorials) implied you need to use a bow and arrow to hunt and no other weapon was acceptable.   I'd say you can hunt with any weapon except when it comes to small animals like rabbits. You're supposed to listen to the character, not the tutorial boxes. If you use a gun on a deer you can still get a perfect pelt, provided you're not hunting with fucking explosive rounds or anything, so long as. It's just if you use a gun you spook every other animal in the area. But since you can only carry so many animals on your horse, there's not so much incentive to not spook all the animals.\n",

The guys were all saying it was fine, they either didn't notice much or felt they could handle it OK.   And a long procession of women were saying how their loving partner or brother tended to become a selfish, arrogant, insensitive, uncaring asshole while on T.  They would refuse to believe their partner's distress was worth stopping the T for.  So long as they didn't hit her they could not see the problem.    T and empathy don't seem to correlate within a group but they strongly correlate in an individual.  It is common for men to become more empathetic as they age, I guess because of falling T.

And every single time, \"No, it's not me, I don't do that shit\".  Well, an old MundaneMatt video was uncovered called \"Poley The Polar Bear\", just a stupid little video of Matt with a Polar Bear puppet with giving his \"Word of the Day\", which just so happened to be \"Nigger\".  So Ralph and Jim start a stream talking about it, and it lasted 30 seconds before it got nuked, and Jim flat out says \"Mundane Matt did this\".  Others join the stream, and say \"Yeah, Matt's doing this, he's been flagging people for years\".  Then Matt turns up on the stream, and says \"It wasn't me!  I was out all afternoon collecting boulders with my kid, we wanted to put boulders in the garden, so I was getting these boulders that this guy was giving away\".  Then, someone said \"Well, if you haven't been flagging people, then show your report history, because it'll be there.  And if you haven't done it, then you have nothing to hide.\"  And it took Matt about 30 minutes to do a job it took everybody else less than 10 seconds.  Then he finally screenshared, and all of the guys he said \"No, I didn't flag him, I don't do that, it's a troll trying to make me look bad!\" turned out he flagged them, he's been doing it for years.\n",
      "7. \t\t\t\t\tSomeone will remember the details, but basically when he was accused of flagging videos, he said it couldn't be him because he was with his family picking rocks in the wild lands at the time.\n",

This narrative that all men are evil and criminals is genuinely bad for us as a society.  This idiot is so far up his own asshole he would ostracize half the population. and condemn them.  &#x200B;  This mindset that men are 100% of the problem is dangerous. Its radical ideologies like this that get people killed. lets face it here people we all know that not all men are pieces of shit. So if the vast majority of people can accept that why cant these fringe group morons.  &#x200B;  There is shitty people everywhere, weather you are white/black/Asian/Hispanic, gay/straight/lesbian, politically right wing/ politically left wing. but here's the real kicker even though there's all sorts of really shitty people from all walks of life. and yes this colossal fuck wit in the post is one of them.  &#x200B;  it takes a truly spiteful, self loathing and shitty person to be able to just blanket entire populations with accusations and paint them with the same brush. and my friends I ask you how long do we allow these toxic cunts to continue this?. im all for freedom of speech. however when it comes to freedom of speech you have to be prepared for the back lash people will give you.   &#x200B;  this idiot and all the other idiots like him seriously needs to be punched in the face maybe then some sense will be knocked into him.  As I said im all for free speech. but just remember everything has a price you may not be incarcerated for saying something super despicable but you may very well get the shit kicked out of you. and honestly I think this guy could benefit from an ass whooping probably by some really tough ladies who are sick of this shit too.  &#x200B;  anyways that's just my two cents.\n",
      "2. \tLike you say, people like him will always exist, in every race, in all walks of life. And among them, I've no doubt there are people like Howey who are predisposed to self-loathing, and generalize it to their entire group in order to feel better about themselves. In the case of men like him, they either assume that every other man is like them, and therefore in need of correction, or they believe it through wishful thinking.  *\"If I can convince myself (and everyone around me) that men* ***in general*** *are toxic, then I don't have to feel as bad about my own toxicity,\"* or so the reasoning goes. A surprising number of male feminists are overcompensating for their own rapey behavior, and [only later turn out to be abusive assholes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_eibEi8DmA). And as cruel as it sounds, I really wouldn't shed a tear if this man got MeToo'd in the next year and a half.  My problem is not that people like him exist – they always have, and they're not going away. It is the fact that they are *listened too*, elevated above others, given blue checkmarks, and held up as examples of how we're supposed to behave. Heck, I'd already heard of Hugh Howey before I came across these tweets, though in hindsight, I'm glad I never bought any of his books.  If someone said something even half as bad about women (or any other gender for that matter), it would rightfully be held up as bigotry. The fact that it is not only socially acceptable to demonize men in this way, but encouraged in the name of \"equality\", is deeply troubling. \n",

      "8. \tOk, this can be a long one. People may think that i'm a hypocrite in saying that we should oppose feminism because they have a lot of sexist and misandrist feminists in their movement, while still I still support the MRM.  First of all I don't hate feminists in the sense that I want them to be killed, hurt, raped, have their rights stripped from them or any such thing. I don't want any harm for them, or to have something bad happen to them as a form of vengeance.  But I still hate feminists nonetheless. Why? Because I feel that every single one of them, even if they didn't do any sexist thing to men or said any misandrist thing to them.   We are all humans, men and women alike, we both can be sexist and hateful, we both have sexist assholes who can infiltrate a a good movement and turn it into a hate one.  The difference between feminism and the MRM is that feminism is more than 100 years old, it appeared in the the late 19th century, but we as movement we are still relatively new compared to them.  Unlike us, they have a lot of power and influence. The most we can have is some mysogynistic assholes who spout some sexist nonsense in an Internet forum. They, in the other hand, can block laws, can pass laws, have feminist presidents in their side, have big feminists journalists, judges and professors. They can and already did a big damage to men.  They did more than just say some sexist shit in the Internet, they actually stopped us many times when we wanted to have our rights or have equality for men under the law or socially.   And despite that a lot of feminists labeled every single MRA as a mysogynist, and with us being a small movement without influence or power, we couldn't do shit.  While every single feminists defended feminism by saying the famous phrase '' those are not real feminists, real feminism is about equality'' and enforced the notion that any single one who criticize feminism is a either a mysogynist male or a woman who suffer from internalized misogyny.  They served as a shield for the feminist movement, which was a platform for misandrist and sexist cunts to hurt men and stop them from getting the equality that they wanted.  The only thing that they did is just say that feminism is a movement for equality and that those are not real feminists. Instead of actually doing something, removing those feminists from the position of power that they have, and actually reversing the damage.  But they only served as a shield, as a defense for the feminist movement, the platform that those misandrists used to fuck men up. Those misandrists who not only had a platform from where they can do the sexist shit that they wanted, they didn't had a real threat to them, since even the feminists who claim to be good didn't try to actively remove them and correct what they have done.  Those good feminists defended feminism even if it made things worse for men, because they used it to get their rights,they used men as a stepping stone to have what they want. The ''good'' feminists had their rights, the bad feminists had the vengeance that they wanted from men.   Those good feminists didn’t want to oppose those misandrists who had the power, because they wanted to preserve their movement so that they can have their rights even if it meant to have men as a stepping stone.  So good feminists, bad feminists, both for men had a role in using feminism as hate movement to fuck men up. And that's why I hate. And I don't the MRM to become like feminism. I don't want us to fall in the same mistake.\n",

Or is it one of those “it’s something I want to be true therefore I automatically believe it” things?  A quick rule for tv, internet, and any other media. If you are shown something that instantly makes you feel a strong emotional reaction of “yeah!!” or “I am very angry about that!” or “That makes me very afraid!”, **you should question it.** A large part of the news and even these quasi news pages is fake, wrong, or simply out of context and the original creator are playing on the knee jerk reactions of emotional people to click and share it.   This goes for mainstream news, justice style videos, and everything else. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

A disclaimer at the end of a video is obviously reasonable since **it's so easy and costs nothing**. You're defending your innocence in lying, which is an attempt to hide the truth. This is an embrace of dishonesty, and that just feels bad no matter what I believe.  >  My stance is closer to a compromise between these.  For one reason or another, you reject the concept of having a responsibility towards others. I said our disagreement will stem from a disagreement about fundamental beliefs. It doesn't matter that you have a 3rd stance or a 234th. It's different. Thus, the law alone will govern us both and not views of morality.

Disclaimer in the credits is less retarded than the solution suggested at the top of this thread by order of magnitude, but still kinda retarded. How many kids do you know that read the credits?

My husband and I are business owners and (subsequently) employers. We do charity and outreach projects through our business (some of which even touch on this issue.)

      "Row 352, Column 'text' has multiple consecutive spaces: '1. I assume you're talking about US history (and leaving aside the gross and murderous injustices of the slave system, which is a book in of itself). Is she aware that voting rights for white men once involved property restrictions? Just as a random example, in Rhode Island in the 1830s, unpropertied men raised a militia and there was violence (Dorr Rebellion). It took decades before property restrictions were lifted for men. It was a slow and unsexy process, so your GF has probably never heard of it.  There were plenty of men's rebellions against economic injustices. Ever heard of Shays' Rebellion? Broke out right after the American Revolution in western Massachusetts, mainly poor farmers. Whiskey Rebellion? Poor farmers in western Pennsylvania had one item they could sell-- whiskey-- and the government put a tax on whiskey which was disproportionately burdensome on them. They were not spared taxation because they were men. How about the Anti-Rent War in upstate NY? Poor farmers revolted against a kind of semi-feudal landlord system in the Hudson river valley.  Is she aware of labor history? The US had a very violent labor history in the 1800s. Working people (overwhelmingly men) clamored for things like a 40 hour work week and weekends off. Does your girlfriend like having the weekend off? I assume she does. Does she think male capitalists freely gave their male workers days off *because they were men?* Did she read the book \"The Jungle\"? Jurgis isn't exactly living high on the hog for most of the book.  If you do your homework, you'll see that rights and benefits were never gifted out to common men, *qua men.* There was often a struggle involved. Powerful men do not favor less powerful men. The factory owner is more likely to spend his money on a fur coat for the wife than parcel out benefits to the men on the factory floor. This isn't rocket science.  Incidentally, the leaders of the early women's movement at Seneca Falls were all comfortably middle class (at least) and had support from their husbands (oh *and servants,* they sometimes had servants too). For instance, Elizabeth Cady Standon and Lucretia Mott met at an antislavery conference in London; their husbands had paid for their tickets. It is a bit rather hard to claim that you're oppressed when your husband not only buys your steamship tickets across the Atlantic but *also* helps you to organize the first women's rights conference because you had no experience organizing conferences before. Right? If you look, you find all of the early women's rights heroines (who struggled!) *nearly all* of them came out of middle class households of the Victorian era. That was the first large group of women in human history to have free time. Consider the significance of that.\n",
      "2. \tI would love to see /u/girlwriteswhat go off on this as she is a better researcher than I will ever be ...      BUT the history of *Human* rights is mostly a history of fighting for *Men's Rights*.  Albeit that the Magna Carta was wealthy landed men fighting for rights against a more powerful institution (in the form of a King) it is implicitly represents a fight for *balancing* the rights and responsibilities of all parties in a society.      The US Revolution was a fight for rights fundamentally.  These rights may originate with landed men, or men, or (gasp) white men but the Western system has repeatedly, and invariably, projected those initial rights onto every person in the society over time.      And women's marches?  Really?  I could not care less.  Even as a pre-teen dragged to these stupid things by my mother I could not help but wonder how useless marches were; especially when conjoined with the endless retarded chanting that happens therein.\n",

Often talk about “that white boy over there” but get offended when a white person says the same in reverse “that black boy over there”.

I noticed that early on that the complainers around me never amounted to much. Everything is someone else’s problem and they never have any part in it themselves. Everything is against them and life is just hopeless.

      "4. \t\tGuys this is the root of the problem: DEMOGRAPHICS. Canadians (really all westerners) are not having babies. Japan is what the future looks like with no immigration, strained gender relations, high male suicide rates and an aging population. Their stock market was flat for 20+ years and the interest rate was zero (even negative), what that means is the people who retired and saved have nothing to show for it, no growth in stocks and bonds. Immigration is a way to keep growing, in our current system it’s the only way unless we magically start having babies. The problem with immigration is that some cultures don’t mix and that leads to problems which could end up being worse than Japan. Europe doesn’t seem keen on repatriating their lost children so they will follow on the same path as us.\n",

Well there's where you shot yourself, obviously looking at parts you want to believe and leaving out the bits you don't agree with. The XY sex-determination system is the sex-determination system found in humans, most other mammals, some insects (Drosophila), some snakes, and some plants (Ginkgo). In this system, the sex of an individual is determined by a pair of sex chromosomes. There you go, hope that clears it up. Maybe you should do some research next time...\n",

      "10. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlthough, i did read some things wrong, i think the part about having xy and being a woman is not one of them. The Swyer syndrome, or XY gonadal dysgenesis, is a condition, in witch babies with xy chromosomes cant develope testicles, and thus get female characteristics. They then get born with those characterristics and live as women for their entire live. I would say that those people are, without a doubt female. Please read the article for more information about it.  The reason i brought this topic up, is to show that chromosomes cant always be used to define the gender of someone, and can be really wierd overall.  I didnt ask you IF sex is determined by chromosomes. I asked you HOW that works. The exact process how the chromosomes controll every aspect of sexual development in humans.\n",
      "11. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat doesn't make them female... yes they are! In fact the disorders can provide evidence for that. Actually research it, I sent you a cut of wiki for that. It's all there. \n",

Love facts as much as the next guy. *But* if feelings didn't matter we wouldn't have them. It's what leads you to say things like \"I can't find a logical argument against incest.\"  In a world where feelings matter, I don't really *need* a logical argument against incest, I can just say \"Know what? It disgusts me.\" And I can avoid saying something thats gonna cause kfarms to raise an eyebrow and make a target out of me. (This is ignoring that we find a distinct overlap in things like consensual incestuous behaviour and things like narcissistic personality disorder, where we find one we often find the other, but whatever right?)  Also people just don't work on facts. Why is Trump in office? Well, primarily he's in office because his opponent was Hillary Clinton. (Literally anyone else would have fucked him to death on election day.) But at least 40% of the reason he's in office is the emotions of his voters.  Alright bad example. Better one, Why do people shoot people who break into their homes? 90% of people breaking into your house just want your TV. This is not a problem that requires lethal force. So why do home invaders get shot? Because the guy holding the gun is scared of the potential fact that the home invader *doesn't* just want his TV. Even though statistically that's most likely *just* not the case.   So yeah, it's great that Destiny can just fling statistics. Even better that he has that kind of brain that can actually recall statistics. I don't think hes ever been caught being wrong about a statistic. But he's arguing from very much the wrong place. (I think even he knows this because in all his arguments he seems to try and lead his opponents to admitting they believe feelings matter.)  And I think you kind of *have* to admit feelings matter in order to be a liberal. Especially if you want to argue that things like racism and sexism are bad. Because if feelings don't matter then \"Know your place silly woman and/or nigger\" become viable arguments. \n",

      "3. \t\tWell, it's the only way you're gonna understand why they're against it.   But see, after deliberating and thinking long and hard about it, I only support gay marriage *because* I think feelings matter.  Gay marriage is *never* going to affect me in any way and I cannot think of a single purely logical reason to support it. My only reason is: \"I mean, I guess if I were gay I would **feel** shitty about not being able to marry my boyfriend.\"  That's my *only* reason. I want gays to get married because their feelings matter to me by way of loose empathy.   As for people who are against gay marriage? Well, that's where facts come in to play. People don't just decide to be gay. There's evidence to suggest that sexuality is decided a long time before birth.  And while feelings do matter, sometimes you just gotta bite the bullet and make a judgement call and hope you land on the side of fact.  In sorry but the Fedora tipping \"facts and logic only\" meme just doesn't work when you apply it to social issues. You've got to make an emotional judgement call sometimes and just fucking hope you get it right. \n",
      "4. \tBy shooting home invaders you not only protect yourself, but the entire neighborhood. It creates a positive externality that discourages other potential home invaders. It is similar to vaccinations where, if enough people are shot, a herd immunity will protect those who don't have the means to replace stolen items or capacity to defend themselves even with firearms. This is also the idea behind concealed carry and allowing teachers to keep firearms so those discouraging it are similar to anti-vaxxers.\n",
      "5. \t\tFair enough, but the thing about a deterrent is, no criminal with half a brain breaks into someone's house while he thinks someone is home. They wait for you to leave, then they break in and take your TV.   Most of the time when a home invader breaks into a house with people still in it, it's because he *thought* they were out and guessed wrong.   And I'm not against guns, someone breaks into your property, fuck it. Shoot them. You don't know how they're going to react when they realise you're home. Better safe than sorry. But the fact is, unless they're a complete idiot they don't think your home.   So I can't really buy your example. A gun as a deterrent really requires a guy holding the gun. \n",

They said several times long before the casting began that they were gonna base the series off of the books, so I and many others rightly assumed that the casting would reflect that. It did not and I'm absolutely pissed about that, but not bringing up the games as an argument, when it was always meant to be a show based on the books is fucking retarded.   This has ZERO to do with elitism, snobbery or whatever, those are the facts. I read the the first book both in the English and German translations, then stuck to the German for the rest, because the English is pretty poor, I also talked to people who read the original, and her hair is clearly described as \"the colour of fresh chestnuts\"...   And the fact that the show is being made because of the popularity of the games doesn't change anything. They clearly said they were gonna base it off of the books and not the games, so getting mad that they didn't keep the changes CDPR made is absolute stupidity. I'm fucking mad that they completely shit over the lore by casting black people for white roles and completely ignore the setting in doing that, but there is no reason to use the games as an argument for what was meant to be a true adaptation of the books. Get THAT fact into YOUR head.\n",

This definition can be applied to police, military, politicians, hell even an employer that threatens to fire employees as a motivational tool!   So much can be defined as \"terrorism\" but something lacking from that definition? A requirement that the person/group you are trying to instill fear in, not being at war with you.  Terrorist/Terrorism are terms that weren't widely used like this before the mid 90's. Why? Because the cold war was over, so was vietnam, and governments needed a bogeyman to instill fear into their populaces, so all freedom fighters guerrila militant groups and so on, get labelled together, to unify these disparate groups as one single enemy.\n",

      "3. \t\tMany years ago an online friend of mine traveled across the country for Sex Reassignment Surgery.   I don't know what the 'rules' are these days ... but she had gone through the entire procedure prior to getting the actual operation. Not the least of which was a lot of therapy and living full time as a woman for a minimum of 12 months.  I think it was while we were waiting for her to be taken to theater that we were talking about it, and I asked if she thought the process was too involved. She told me (as best I can recall) that there were times when she felt that it was and was frustrated, but in retrospect that a lot of what was going on was designed to ensure that she was entirely sure about the choice she was making, and as well informed as humanly possible about the consequences.  After the surgery (and after she had recovered from the anesthesia which had knocked her around a bit) she was happy.  We lost touch a couple of years later, but she was still happy and I hope she still is to this day.   I think, as you note, her being happy was because she had been given realistic expectations.  Then we see people like Milo Stewart (a transtrender from youtube, if you weren't aware) who just wander off to an 'informed consent' clinic and start hormones with virtually no real preparation. And we see comments saying \"Your so brave\" and \"U r valid\" (yes ... they generally are that illiterate) and then down the track we see them start posting videos like  >My Non-Binary Dysphoria  Say WHAT?  >Asexuality, sex and Kink  Which starts with the sentence \"Hi! I'm an asexual and I have a lot of gay sex\". Seriously.  >Am I still asexual?! What's my sexual orientation?  The gist is \"I no longer identify as asexual\". No shit sherlock.  >CONFESSION: I can't orgasm  I wonder why?  After which Milo had clearly stopped using testosterone and now their voice is all over the place.  I compare the two, and I see that one was clearly well prepared for her ordeal. And the other has basically ruined their life.\n",

Ran into... \"Stephanie\" at Toys R Us, she was still basically Steve with the Transformers collection, just wearing a dress. Unfortunately, she had become conceited as fuck during the time. Not sure if the surgery had happened yet. After that, he completely disappeared but I found he moved to the other side of the country.

But if you’re actually interested in an answer I can give that to you. I am the breadwinner in my relationship, and I’m a woman. I do feel appreciated, but I haven’t always. For a while my husband was jobless, and that put a definite strain on me.I work in a very up and down field, I can have a phenomenal week and then a shit one right after. So I guess it was less about feeling under appreciated and more about feeling a ton of stress to provide.    I’ve always been the breadwinner in our relationship, and I enjoy working and making good money. Actually just this year I’ve opened my own business.    I don’t feel as respected as a breadwinner compared to a male counterpart. Many people I tell ask me how my husband feels, if he’s okay with it. Some laugh, others pity me. We are happy with our dynamic and that’s all that really matters.    I understand you guys have a certain stance about women here.... and there are some women who fit that stereotype. But I encourage you to realize that, like men, we are all different. I don’t expect huge gifts from my husband, nor did I ask for a big ring - actually I insisted we purchase fake ones.

(and btw, that chart is wrong. the average iq is still higher for men you just can't research it and can't say things like that because muh patriarchy in the academic field will get offended. but it doesn't really matter, what matters is the higher iq humans are predominantly male)  have you seen a tinder profile of the average women? they are all the same.  have you seen the latest fashion trends? who are into it?? who? the guys or the girls?  spotify or groovshark idk provided data about gender and genre. guess what? women preferred the latest mainstream trendy pop while men had all kind of variety.  women are hivemind. do your own research or just open your fucking eyes or learn history, literally it is in front of your pathetic nose. i can't help another random retard on the internet. told you already just stop wasting my time and stop insulting me. thank you!\n",

I responded to the insult because there is absolutely no \"actual point\", it's just a jab at the \"leftist retard\" PM.  Let's go over the facts, shall we?  The supreme court [ruled in 2010](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7842/index.do) that Canada failed in its constitutional obligations to Khadr on several counts, most notably that Canadian officials breached Khadr's rights by interrogating him knowing that he had been tortured (their term is \"oppressive circumstances\") and that the Canadian government had failed to uphold Khadr's constitutional rights when it ignored Khadr's request for repatriation.   This all occurred under Harper's time as PM; the payout was the result of a settlement coming from Khadr's $20M suit against Canada for wrongful imprisonment and failing to protecting him as a Canadian citizen.  Now we can argue all day what you or I would have done as PM, but with the SCOC ruling that Canada had in fact failed its citizen and the $20M pending lawsuit, Canada decided to settle. Would you be as angry if Canada had decided to let the suit proceed and risk a $20M payout on top of legal fees and court costs? Remember that it was your boy Harper who created this mess, and the full impact wasn't seen until after he'd been booted out of office.  We can also argue all day whether you would consider the SCOC's decision was a demand to pay Khadr $10.5M or not, but it seems prudent that if the SCOC has already ruled that you fucked up and the man you fucked has a $20M suit against you, you might want to try to cut a deal, no? So in terms of absolute \"who made who do what\" no, the court did not force the payout, but they sure strongly encouraged Canada to settle, would you not agree?  Trudeau said something that I think is particularly important in this discussion, and something that /r/metacanada tends to forget a great deal of the time. \"The Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects all Canadians, every one of us, even when it is uncomfortable.\" The SCOC ruled that Canada failed Khadr.  I'll leave you with an interesting thought exercise: If Harper had won in 2015 it's entirely plausible that the same outcome would have resulted. Would you be just as outraged if it was your boy who made the financially sound decision to settle? \n",
      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\t \"Oppressive Circumstances\" -- Is that what you would call someone who has engaged in terrorist activities; namely killing a U.S. solider and then requests damages for being interrogated to find further terrorist ties?   The fact that Canada agreed to settle for an individual that has terrorist ties, engaged in terrorist activities, killed a U.S. solider (I'm sure their family and friends would be ecstatic that the murderer of their dad, husband, son, friends etc are being rewarded with a $10m gift).   And, of course we got leftists willing to defend the rights of an individual known to engage in terrorism to deaths door; but censorship of right wing views -- that's normal. What this sub and so many others talk shit about is not the fact that he was in a lawsuit and could have potentially got paid more; we argue why an individual known to engage in terrorism is somehow getting justification for this and getting paid on top? You wouldn’t be fighting for this mans right if it was your father, your brother, or your husband (I don’t know your sexuality or sex for that matter) being killed. Perhaps you wouldn’t seek vengeance, but you would be livid if you saw a government paying an individual engaged in terrorist activities. If we’re going to pay this guy 10.5m because he’s reformed and he had psychological issues (which is why he took up arms). Why don’t we start importing all the terrorists and start arguing that they just had some sort of mental issue and we can fix it. All we need to do is get them a great doc and a lot of money preferably $10m or higher and they’ll reform. Trust me, these folks are golden. They’ll be the most peaceful, welcoming, and produce citizens we’ve seen yet.   His sister, known to defend 9/11 attacks and known to aid al Qaeda (and I didn’t bother researching the rest of the family) is reason enough for investigation. If your family is linked to a major terrorism group, you’re going to get investigated to ensure that 1 you’re not engaged in activities such as these yourself (which he was), 2 you’re not supporting this behavior through funding, and 3 verify if you have any information linked to terrorism or the terrorism group.  Harper is not my \"boy\" so I don't really give a shit what \"my boy Harper\" would have done. Regardless, Trudeau is a fucking moron. A spineless retard that thinks with the “heart out” and is more concerned about virtual signaling than justice. The widow of the solider - Christopher Speer - filed an injunction application to block any payout to Khadr which was filed in the Ontario Superior Court — but this women’s feelings and her dead husband doesn’t matter here now does it.\n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tSo, I take the time to answer your question as thoroughly as I can and you respond by going off on a tangent about how the SCOC didn't do their job correctly?  The SCOC case was about whether Khadr's rights were violated. I am no lawyer but I don't think the scope of their job included trying to figure out how Khadr ended up fighting for the enemy as a 15yo. Despite what your (and my) knee-jerk response is, he was a minor at this time. I believe that the SCOC ruling is fair.  The debate about whether Khadr was radicalized by his family or not is an entirely separate subject. The debate over whether he should have been considered a child soldier or not is another entirely separate subject. His family ties and history is irrelevant to the SCOC ruling and to the eventual settlement. You can't choose to ignore a person's constitutional rights based on family history or upbringing.  Whether you like it or not, Khadr was a minor when all of this happened. I don't know if you have children, but I do, and having raised a few teenagers and am in the process of raising a few more I can fully understand how a child can look and mostly act like a fully-functioning adult yet not have the mind nor ability to fully think as one. This is a fact that a lot of people forget about teenagers. Especially if Khadr's family is as you describe, Khadr may have not had much of a chance to do the right thing due to his upbringing. I know I sure as hell would never have sent my 15 to a war zone to act as a translator. That's probably the biggest WTF in all of this.  In a way I rather like that the US immediately tried to find a way to gain access to Khadr's settlement in order to help not only Speer's family, but also Morris, who was wounded. I think it's rather telling how there was no suit mentioned until there was blood in the water, so to speak. Seeking justice would have been filing suit against Khadr and his parents whether there was $10.5M on the table or not; Much like Canada's settlement with Khadr, there was no suit filed until it made financial sense. \"Justice\" isn't this nuanced.  I retract my statements about Harper being your guy; Most people here think that Harper was flawless and that  Bernier is some kind of political messiah. As I said in my original post in this thread, there are a lot of things to slag Trudeau over, but this $10.5M settlement is not one of them. Khadr's payout and everything leading up to it are a result of Harper's decisions.\n",
      "9. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat's the basis of the argument. Why is a terrorist being given any validity to a human rights claim of $20million... By that logic and your logic, any minor that commits murder can be pardoned and paid because they've had a rough upbringing. Except, it doesn't work that way. A minor can go to jail; regardless of whether or not they had a messed up past. You may get a less serious sentence but you don't get pardoned.   A lot of kids that get in trouble by the law today never had a \"chance\" to have a great upbringing. We don't give them $10 million as an apology.  The basis of our arguments are different. \n",
      "10. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWell again... how many teenagers did you hang around who have had their constitutional rights violated? This isn't about pushing over gravestones or stealing a car or even committing murder and getting a huge payout.  Khadr was 15 when he was sent to a warzone to work as a translator and ended up on the losing end of a firefight. How much autonomy did you have at that age? Now at Guantanamo, Canadian officials interviewed him despite knowing full well that he'd been tortured and then our government refused to repatriate him.  This is quite a unique case and nothing at all like some rando teen murdering someone in their neighbourhood; surely you can see that?  Let's also not forget that it's not been conclusively proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he's the one who threw the grenade that killed Speer and wounded Morris. I have no strong opinion either way but I think it should be conclusively proven that he's the one who pulled the trigger, so to speak.  Also keep in mind that the SCOC was not charged with figuring out his guilt or innocence; the case before the courts was about determining whether Canada had failed him from a constitutional standpoint. You seem to be conflating these two issues, as if there are things you can do which would strip you of your rights as a citizen of Canada.  an aside: I FULLY endorse stripping citizenship from anyone who fights for a foreign power, but Canada did not do this, likely because stripping someone of their citizenship is a whole other can of worms that Canada did not want to open. This does not mean that Canada gets to decide not to uphold his rights. The law doesn't work that way, no matter how much of a shitbag you may be. \n",
      "11. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRegardless of upbringing, you commit terrorism you don't get to say it was due to my circumstances. It's unfortunate but it is what it is. Many terrorists I'm sure grew up in that environment. Nothing we can do. Doesn't mean we start giving them $10m as a human rights violation. What about the wife of the solider who died. She has to live with the trauma and her family of having no husband. Does she get 10m? Does she get the share of the \"payout\" by the generous Canadian gov for this \"minors\" brave acts?  \n",
      "12. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI've covered all of these points and more. I suggest reading over my comments again. \n",
      "13. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI disagree that's why I keep repeating myself. Its retarded. Any terrorist can claim human rights violations then. I have nothing more to say. I don't understand why this wouldn't apply to every single minor that's a terrorist currently. Why don't we pay all of them 10.5m.\n",
      "14. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerhaps I can make it a little more clear:  Khadr is a Canadian citizen. SCOC ruled that the Canadian government failed to uphold its constitutional obligations to Khadr. Khadr sued for $20M, Canadian gov settled for a little over half than that.  Want to avoid this in the future? Strip these people of their Canadian citizenship, at which point Canada no longer has any constitutional obligations to them. This has nothing to do with a political party; this is the rule of law in Canada. \n",
      "15. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat's exactly what I'm criticizing.\n",
      "16. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAre you upset that the court upheld the rights of a citizen you don’t particularly care for, or are you upset that Canada didn’t do the “right thing” and strip him if his citizenship before refusing to respect his rights?  “Right thing” in quotes because I’m not reasonably sure that stripping citizenship from someone doing treasonous things as a 15yo brought up the way you described is necessarily right. \n",
      "17. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou ignored my arguments. By this logic, every Canadian minor engaged in terrorism is eligible for 10m due to humans right violations.   Edit: I forgot to add they were interrogated due to their involvement in terrorist activity.\n",
      "18. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI didn’t ignore your arguments; you’re ignoring the fact that the ONLY reason Khadr got anything was because Canada didn’t fulfil its constitutional obligations. Canada could have tried to strip him of citizenship but didn’t. Canada could have refused to interrogate him knowing he’d been tortured. Canada could have repatriated him and tried him in Canadian court. The majority conservative government of Canada acted in half measures at every opportunity and got slapped for it.   Direct your anger where it belongs. Had Canada done it’s duty to Khadr he wouldn’t have had a dime. \n",

It's not like Stripe is in the same area as these ideological abusers who show us day after day, week after week that rules only apply to people that don't follow their dogmatic principles. Stripe and twitter are a *whole* mile and a half from each other!   All of that, in case you can't tell, is sarcasm. Dry wit, if you will.   The **fact** is: This cabal of tech companies has shown a willingness to work together against people. Consider also: Censorship like this also directly negatively impacts the ability of people who wish to consume a viewpoint, or, in this case, just want to laugh at gay-frog memes.  Oh and, spare me your \"But ____ can still put out information on _____\". Yes, we've all heard it before.

Warm climate + rain = bacteria, meat spoils quicker. Spices act as an antiseptic. Keep food fresher longer. Protect from harmful bacteria. You know how Russians pickle *everything*? Same reason, except in their cases it's the cold winters that make them do this. Gotta have some way of preserving the vegetables.   European cuisine traditionally didn't mix spices too much, it usually picked just one kind and added it a little bit to preserve the original flavor. Cultures like India added them in abundance, which resulted in an explosion of flavors.   And honestly? Taste is subjective. It's just food. You eat it and then poop it out.

How is this so hard to understand?  Edit: Did you really think you could ghost edit your comment and I wouldn't notice? Sneaky beta cucks will be sneaky beta cucks, I guess. Here's my reply to rest of your garbage.  You don't have to explicitly say something for me to follow your reasoning to it's logical conclusion. If you truly think the man was in the wrong for hitting back then you either don't view women as equals to men or think women should be afforded extra privileges alongside the equal rights they already have. This would make you a sexist or a supremacist, pick your poison.  I don't like double standards for one reason. It creates inequality. I don't want women to be let off the hook for ASSAULT just because \"muh wamen\" as much as I don't want men let off the hook for ASSAULT because \"muh men.\" The moment you start allowing double standards to be normalized is the moment you take your first step towards an unequal, tiered justice system. Women wanted equality and this is what it looks like. If you or anyone else has a problem with it then maybe you all should admit women meant just the benefits of equality with none of the responsibility.  I recognized your type of asinine argumentation and stopped you before you could waste my time with arguments that this sub has debunked thousands of times before. The only reason you're crying about a straw man, throwing out character assassinations, and incorrectly declaring my arguments as invalid is because I didn't give you the chance to act like a smug faggot. If you had any arguments that weren't what I called out ahead of time you would've posted them.   Go back to two x chromosomes for your \"yas queens\" and validation of your ridiculous views.

This is only misogynist if you’re an idiot who sees it as misogyny when there aren’t enough female characters for you or when anything bad happens to a female character.

Most of what we know of the depths of his hate comes from his wife — who wasn’t trying to speak ill of him, just tell it like it was.

He was actually recorded stating he’s just going to pour it out and only give her a warning but SHE fucked that up.   2) She was being a total uncooperative bitch. Being a woman she thinks she’s untouchable and can fight someone twice her size. When reality hits THEN she she wants to cry about it. If you want to talk tough you need to be tough, not cry for white knights like you to come save her.   3) reasonably you know people don’t just pack and have alcohol for decorative purposes. She was going to drink it at some point. She knew she was in trouble so does what scared chihuahuas do, bark and scream and pee a little bit. Even without suspicion, you don’t just walk away from a police officer.

You're too stupid and wrong to address the argument that's literally listed as   1 (open display is illegal)   2 (she was being uncooperative) and   3 (reasonable people dont pack alchohol not to drink),   but if you wanna keep focusing on your hurt feelings we'll just leave the argument, acknowledge that you're too dumb to realize you're completely wrong about giving her a pass and move on!

But a hot blooded officer working a shit beat in the sun all day in uniform on the beach who’d just been proven wrong certainly wouldn’t be in the mood to take any lip from the female who was just proven right, now would he? So he keeps on without any reason, escalating a situation that had absolutely no cause to be escalated at that point.  I can understand if you hate women, sincerely, but at least be able to admit it when all you’re doing here is relishing in seeing a woman get beat down. Don’t pretend that her being a smart ass was illegal. Don’t pretend that she was in possession of something illegal. Don’t pretend she was drunk.

Let me help you out here. 1: Men can be penetrated. It doesn't take another man to do that. That's one way a woman can rape a man. 2: Erections are about stimulation and blood flow, not always sexual attraction. Hint: \"Morning wood\" doesn't always happen because you want to have sex as soon as you wake up or because you had a wet dream. That's another way a woman can rape a man. 3: This one is important: CHILDREN ARE UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT FOR SEX. **ANY TIME** a 14 year old has sex, it's a form of rape. 100% of the time, at least in the United States (because I don't know specific fucked up laws in other countries), sex with a 14 year old is rape.\n",

She comes to you and cries about it, asking you to make it stop. Police get involved, as does the media.   You, or your daughter, are browsing online and see comments about the article. You find a comment with someone saying “one rape please”, as if the situation is kosher.  Imagine how you, as the dad, or your daughter would feel reading that.   I’m not for the whole sjw bullshit that’s been going on. I’m not for the safe space don’t offend anyone shit.

In factory farming, no chick ever has any chance to have a nice life, ever, for any amount of time.    Furthermore, coyotes don't have the option of using rational thought and empathy to recognize the chicks' pain and come up with a humane way to dispatch the chick.     Humans DO feel empathy and we DO KNOW how to be humane, but we choose not to.   Especially in certain countries.   In the US, you can kill a chick or chicken fairly painfully, and with tremendous panic in the bird.  In the UK, rules are more humane. This why the UK strictly regulates the nitrogen/oxygen gas mixture used to euthanize birds, so that the birds simply pass out without panic (as opposed to using a mixture or a gas that stimulates a panic response).\n",

Does it all just boil down to \"avoiding pain/fear at all costs.\"  Empathy for prey isn't rational, it's emotional.  Rational is saying, \"look this thing is gonna die anyway, so let's turn it into a chicken mcnugget.\"  I mean it's an interesting moral quandry.  \"The industrialization of life and death.\"  Definitely makes me question alot of things, the basis of human society even.  But if we're doing that, then we might as well question all life itself, question whether it's not just better for most things not to be born.  Being born = Fear/Pain  Is it our place to play god?  Isn't fear/pain simply an organic chemical reaction? Why should it be avoided in prey animals?  Just so we can feel better about ourselves?  The luxury of western feelgoodism where you order the vegetarian meal and forget all about the animal getting ripped apart by lions.  I'll be honest with you, I /do/ want that luxury for myself.  I want the luxury of thinking of myself as humane and ethical.

We on the other hand have already decided we only care about ourselves.   \n",
      "5. \t\t\t\tWell the pro-meat argument is that every species cares about itself. Lions are so tender and nurturing of their own kittens, but they go snap the necks of baby hyenas. Because they are in competition over food and survival. Likewise humans want to provide the cheapest and best food to fellow humans, they don't want meat to be $20/pound just so the chickens can not suffer. Empathy is all well and dandy, but at a certain point it becomes retarded. Everybody always wants to save the cute animals like dolphins while they fry up the butt-ugly fish in butter sauce. I mean that's the empathy gap right there. People have empathy for cute things. If you're ugly, people are like \"fuck that nigga, get in the frying pan.\"\n",

This is what the public service broadcaster funded by the citizens of the 5th largest economy in the world has to offer - tumblrisms and levels of journalism which makes Huffpo, Buzzfeed and Gawker to look like Pulitzer prize winning media. The very fact that this vomit inducing garbage is allowed to be published is beyond disgusting.  Let that sink in.\n",

      "3. \t\tOh, no, I'm aware of that. I'm very well aware that reporting on news and events was never unbiased, not just in BBC, pretty much everywhere. I was born and grew up in a former Soviet satellite state in Eastern Europe which was ruled by a genuine hardcore communist party for half a century (not the Antifa larping fragile mangina cucks you see on the streets today). We essentially had one and only one news source distributed by the Party and all other alternative sources were completely subservient to the Party anyway. Anyone who even tried to think differently was sent on a one way trip to a concentration camp... 'scuse me - \"labor\" camp. And this was going on until 1989. Trust me when I tell you - I am painfully aware and \"trained\" to spot bias, it's pretty much a second nature.  I guess my point is that I'm not that much disappointed by the BBC bias, that's a given. But by the thing they are reporting on. Even in the \"good old\" communist propaganda days journalists were busy reporting on real issues, actual events, actual politics. Something that affects everyone, that everyone knows, everyone understands and cares about, something that is affecting your life, something that has a meaning. An election, politicians meeting, an armed conflict, economics, crime etc. Despite the obvious bias, news were actually meaningful and valuable news, not diluted garbage that makes no sense.  Do you think that even half of the population now knows what \"misogynoir\" means when they hear or read this drivel on the news? Or what \"gamer girl\" is? Or \"preferred gender pronoun\" is? This is what I'm upset about. Not the bias, the fact that these \"giants\" of journalism are wasting tax payers money and time to report on completely useless garbage, the fact that some moron with a gender studies degree gets paid from our own pockets to present something so retarded as \"some chick got called a bitch while playing a video game\" as actual news.

My guess is that the water began to fill the kayak before it flipped, and then once he flipped, the water held the kayak down in the water.

Based on the report, we tightly review every single item and remove the item from the shop, and from the inventory of the players who purchased, and ban player accounts. Content containing sexual, racist, hateful or other inappropriate items are flagged higher in priority for removal. Players who post offensive items or images are subject to being banned permanently from the game. We have been acting very quickly and ask that whenever players see those items in the shop to report immediately using the report button.  > Given the volume of the reports, there has been a delay in the review process.

I do not know enough details about their situation, but neither does the OP. Furthermore, he is using the wrong channels to report any suspected crime. The only correct manner to address these suspicions are through https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/protect-fraud/report-fraud.html  In the end there's only two pieces of proof, one of which is Alinity speaking in a manner that is dubious on the intent in the first place. Especially without the surrounding content of that conversation, the clip is easily pulled out of context. The other piece of \"proof\" used by these people consists of a series of tweets from her ex-husband that it was him who pulled the plug. We have no further proof other than these two things and that by itself isn't enough to warrant a public post and petition to get someone removed from a country.  In fact, the more I think about it, the more it feels as if OP was denied something by Alinity and now tries to enact vengeance on her through shoddy defamation. OP needs to be VERY careful before he himself becomes liable for legal action.\n",

Is this about black Heimdall and black Domino and the lack of outrage about them being race bent while people start forging flaming pitchforks over a black Ciri or Superman?  Well, I'd argue that as supporting characters they are given more freedom to be fluid in their race and possibly even sex. They don't have the same identity with the public like a main character like Superman does.

I was mad at Prince of Persia casting. Since I love those games, and know the character. Still haven't bothered to watch the movie. Also hated Fan4stic for racebending Johnny. That fundamentally changed character dynamics of a brother and sister. It's just retarded. People defended with with Alba \"not being white\" except she's half white so it's not really that comparable.   generally I'm against it even if I don't know the character, since there's almost always existing characters they could use instead. See Starfire in Titans, when they could've just used Bumblebee if they wanted to use a black woman to play an ORANGE alien [that they didn't paint orange].   And there's always the option to invent a new character. I believe the Asian police officer in the new Spider-Man game was invented recently in the comics.   But these people aren't creative. So they just swap races with existing characters. They could create the next Harley Quinn if they were talented, but they're devoid of talent. Which is why their great ideas are to just change an existing character's race. \n",

She was already on probation for something she did a year or so before, and knew that she wasn't supposed to be drinking because 1) She's underage and 2) It's illegal to have an open container on most beaches in the NY/NJ area. If you're of age, there are people who drink but are smart enough to not get piss drunk and who don't leave it in an obvious container, neither of which this dimwit was smart enough to do.  When it came to light that she was already on probation, a habitual liar (who started the fight), a single mom at 18-19 that kept referring to the father of her kid as \"baby daddy\" (media had reported that they were still together, they were not, so she apparently had to make that clear?) and an overall shitty human with terrible decision making skills, things didn't work out the way she wanted. The media outlets were trying to go for a more wholesome \"Random mother attacked in front of her child and family for no reason\" and when it turned out that none of it was true, the story kind of died off.

The following pictures show the crime scene and blood spatter at the Charlie Hebdo officesr:  [A](https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_02/840371/150108-charlie-hebdo-interior-jsw-328p_15bea17469a1bfaf4b789d918f4204b1.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg) [B](http://previously.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016-09-19-hebdo-scene-of-war.jpg)  I've also seen a video from inside the building where Charlie Hebdo was housed, one of the men who fled the shooting from a different floor tried to take cover in this are and was hunted and shot to death by the attackers.  Most people are unware of how much blood a single person can bleed out from a gunshot wound. The fact that 12 people were shot to death tells you that every floor was covered in blood, including from the boot prints of the attackers.  I can't help but be *absolutely furious* about people who *at first* said Je Suis, saw some of these pictures, and eventually said, \"It's their fault because they were offensive. They should just stop being so offensive.\"  If you can rationalize offices covered in blood because they said offensive things, rationalize a truck bomb is nothing.  Then came their *guilt tripping* of people mourning for Paris and the victims of the Bataclan attack. \"How dare you! Lebanon had it worse a few weeks ago! What about Black Lives Matter? Did you ever consider that this is France's fault?\"  I was losing my shit reading the news that year.  My point is, there's absolutely *no reason* to believe that the SJWs can't rationalize a terrorist attack inside the US against a government agency like Border Patrol or ICE, when they've already rationalized Charlie Hebdo and Bataclan. When somebody like Anderson Cooper comes out and rationalizes a left-wing terrorist attack on a federal building (a la Timothy McVeigh or Dwight Armstrong), and says: \"The *real* victims here are the victim's of Trump's immigration policy\"; the resulting normie blowback will be so angry that it may ravage the political left, and possibly destroy the democratic party, in this country. That's not a good ending, but I'm concerned it's where we are headed anyway.\n",
      "3. \t\t> My point is, there's absolutely no reason to believe that the SJWs can't rationalize a terrorist attack inside the US against a government agency like Border Patrol or ICE  I mean, hasn't 9/11 in many ways been rationalized away at this point? \"Just a few bad apples, and well, we DID stick are noses in the Middle-East...\"  Funny, this past weekend Conor McGregor fought, and as part of his pre-fight hype he outed his opponent's manager as being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood of America who had personal ties to 9/11 and turned CIA double-agent-snitch in the aftermath (while being a deadbeat dad, to boot). Naturally, members of the press were appalled... by MCGREGOR'S anti-Islamic rhetoric!\n",
      "4. \t\t\t>I mean, hasn't 9/11 in many ways been rationalized away at this point? \"Just a few bad apples, and well, we DID stick are noses in the Middle-East...\"  Not nearly to the same extent. If they believe it, they don't talk about it.  >who had personal ties to 9/11 and turned CIA double-agent-snitch in the aftermath   That is a *metric fuckton of shit-talking*.  Imma wait for evidence.\n",

The NYPD and FBI simply did not trust him because his interrogation seemed suspicious (polygraphs are bullshit), that doesn't mean that he *necessarily* betrayed them.\n",

You mean the self-proclaimed male feminist, who was accused falsely, and legitimately felt bad about the situation and tried his best to make things right despite the fact that again, he did nothing wrong. Who by the way, he was never forced to take a breather, he never took a breather, and the idea of him not continuing to do his thing was never brought into question by anyone... This woman is so fucked in the head. This is without question someone who is a sociopath.  > Ansari’s charges  He was charged with nothing, you deranged demonizing psycho cuuuuunt.  > the reality is that many women are still taught  Its always interesting reading a feminist start the sentence with this, and always end it with lies. Women are taught they are always the victim, they should always be afraid, men are stupid and below them, and should worship them. I could go on. They are never taught to be the caretakers of the male ego, no evidence to support that.  > We learn at an early age to value ourselves based on our ability to be agreeable, to please others, to silence our anger.   This one makes me laugh, this applies to all human beings, and its called not being a shit head. Is that really difficult to do?  > To deny that this is still reinforced to young women daily is a privilege of ignorance and convenience.   Privilege of ignorance and convenience is not ever seeing men as victims.  > I feel bad for what Ansari endured.   If that was true, you wouldn't be demonizing and attempting to twist words into suggesting he was actually charged with sexual assault, you sick fuck.  > But if anything is clear from this post-accusation world, it’s that empathy doesn’t seem to come easy for these guys. Unlike most (not all) women, who apologize so often that we have professional support groups to stop us, their response is not to feel sorry for what their accusers might have been feeling; there’s not an ounce of real self-reflection to be found. Instead, they are furious at being policed. For the first time, we are not care-taking their egos. And I have never seen them so mad.  This is perfect. This is so fucking perfect. At no point in time does any of this make any sense what so ever... until you flip the genders haha. Seriously.  \"it’s that empathy doesn’t seem to come easy for these guys. \"  Empathy doesn't come easy for this woman, she literally implied he got charged for sexual abuse over a false accusation she has still yet to mention is false. Thats called zero fucking empathy.   \"their response is not to feel sorry for what their accusers might have been feeling; there’s not an ounce of real self-reflection to be found.\"  Women like this make no attempt to feel sorry for what their accusers have been feeling, and this woman has yet to provide any self-reflection so far in her article lol. This is fucking gold.  \"Instead, they are furious at being policed. For the first time, we are not care-taking their egos.\"  This is every single person who has a negative response to mens rights activism.   \" And I have never seen them so mad.\"  lmfao, she writes in an article filled with her crying, ranting and raging about men. Yea, okay hun, uhhh, kind of hard to take you seriously with that comment when you're foaming at the mouth.   > If he offered even a sliver of empathy, an acknowledgment that the “creepy dudes” he once referred to in his bits, are everywhere — so much so that he didn’t even realize he was one of them — maybe it would have struck a chord.  I think if you read in between the lines its pretty obvious why this woman is raging so hard, if she offered a sliver of empathy, a guy doing nothing wrong and being *falsely* accused wouldn't have struck a chord. That and the fact that what she is saying literally makes no logical sense what so ever, Aziz was so upset he moved on and continued working? Where is she getting this information that Aziz was angry?  >  Instead, they cling to the same aggression and anger that got them in trouble in the first place — and that bit is getting old.

I feel like the media and the democrats focused too hard on the sexual assault thing, instead of literally every other aspect of him that's shitty. The dude has no problem disregarding certain parts of the constitution, and would be quite likely to give the president more powers if he had the chance - so yeah, by making the sexual assault their main mode of attack and turning it into a witch hunt without enough evidence, the dems shot themselves in the foot.  To be honest I'm mostly conflicted about the result.

When you're being appointed to one of the highest positions in the country, it's imperative that you know how to maintain your composure in high pressure situations, and handle yourself properly.

      "4. \t\t\tThe problem is **Islam is not a religion that changes its words**.   #Ever  The words written by the prophet Muhammad are the absolute final words of Allah himself, and [Allah was very, VERY clear of that.](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam)   So 15 centuries ago they may have been very forward thinking, but the religion is **absolutely locked in** to the words of 15 centuries ago. So when Allah said women are worth half of a man 15 centuries ago, they're going to be worth half of a man until the heat death of the universe.\n",
      "5. \t\t\t\tThis is false. Some of the most drastic changes any religion has ever over gone culturally took place in Islam following the Umayyad dynasty (750 ce), and even that religion is nothing like modern Islam. This opinion of your stems from complete and utter ignorance. Veiling, one of the most identifiable part of Islam today, wasn't even a critical part of the religion less than 600 years ago. And pointing out that the five pillars doesn't do a whole lot to prove your point. Judaism has almost the exact same thing, so why isn't that a problem?  The problem with Islam isn't that it hasn't changed, it's that it's changed in a negative way.\n",
      "6. \t\t\t\t\t\"..for the male, what is equal to the share of two females...\" [Surah Nisa’ 4:11 ](https://quran.com/4/11)  And literally 3 lines later, in case you were thinking of giving women more:   \"And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits - He will put him into the Fire to abide eternally therein, and he will have a humiliating punishment.\" [Surah Nisa’ 4:14](https://quran.com/4/14)   I'm pretty sure the Quran is pretty damn certain that a woman gets half of what a man gets. Forever. It's right there in the ink. Because of the first pillar of Islam, this does not change. It can not change because to change it would be going against Muhammad and the will of Allah. In this way, Islam is not a religion that changes.  It's not \"ignorance\" when I'm directly quoting the word of Allah, \"ignorance\" would be not knowing or following Allah's word.\n",
      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\tYou're such a retard. If this religion can't change, then explain to me why veiling came to be. Explain to me why there is a distinct cultural difference between Sunni and Shi'a Islam on top of distinct cultural differences between Islam from the Umayyad and Abbasid Dynasties as well as everything following that. Also, explain to me why Sufism is an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SECT OF ISLAM THAT IS CENTERED AROUND ALIGNING CLOSER TO MUHAMMADS **ORIGINAL** MESSAGE, rather than the corrupt version that the Umayyad's turned it into. You saying that Islam has never changed is completely denying that Sufism exists, as well denying that over 1000 years of history exists. I'm not saying that Islam is good in anyway, I'm just pointing out that you saying Islam can't change is completely unfounded and bullshit. This isn't something that's proved by \"the word of allah\" or some other bullshit like that, but by actual WRITTEN HISTORY. YOU CANT ARGUE WITH WRITTEN HISTORY RETARD. But then again you probably have no idea what Sufism is or that there were Islamic Dynasties in the first place, so I can really only blame myself for getting angry at your ignorance.   Edit: but you're so wrapped up in wanting to shit talk islam like every other retard on this sub that you have to make it about equality instead of what I'm actually talking about. we get it, islam fucking blows, shut the fuck up\n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt seems we're having a bit of a communication error here (ironic because we're discussing Islam) I wasn't specific in my original post because I didn't think I was going to get into such a long-winded debate. My language was too broad.  What I meant by my original posts is that the texts and pillars that Islam is based on are the absolute word of Allah and will never change. The interpretation of those texts certainly may which leads to splits such as those in Sunni, Shia, and Sufism. For instance, [Surah An-Nur 24:31](https://quran.com/24/31)  says that women must cover themselves, but the extent at which they cover themselves is up for interpretation.  When the word of Allah says to do something, that word cannot change. Whereas in other Abrahamic faiths it can. An example is the entire book of Leviticus in Christianity becoming absolutely null and void over time. This would never happen in the Islamic faith because the entirety of the Quran the absolute true word and will of Allah.  In this way, Islam, when compared to other faiths, \"does not change\" because its foundations leave far less room for interpretation. \n",
      "9. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSorry for the communication problem, but this isn't what ends up happening in practice. The majority of Muslims aren't following the Qur'an word for word similar to most other Christians. While there are a larger majority of traditional Muslims compared to traditional Christians, but I would argue that this is mostly due to the region rather than their holy book being the direct word of god because, looking at Jews and Hindus surrounding the Islamic world, that entire region is traditional. And I can't see this being a huge barrier in social progress because it other religions it hasn't been. At most it will slow Islam down by 50 years, and I think it's arguable that we're in that 50 year transition period right now. However, I still do now understand and recognize your view of this. I really need to go do homework now (ironically its about islam), so I'm going to end off here. Sorry for the rocky start and misunderstandings \n",

PayPal is a business and can choose who to do business with, so long as they aren't making that determination based on a protected class (race, gender, etc). No business is obligated to offer services to someone with whose views they don't agree, and though I would prefer this not apply to payment providers (whose only service is moving money around), unfortunately it does.  The Unruh Civil Rights Act they cite makes no mention of political affiliation. It specifically outlaws discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, mental or physical disability, age or medical condition (including HIV status). HOWEVER (and this is what Jones is banking on) the California Supreme Court has held that the protections of the Unruh Act are not restricted to these characteristics.  That being said, extending its protection to cover what can be characterized as conspiracy theories and related nonsense is going to be a really hard sell. If Paypal was discriminating against a guy for his choice of political candidate, maybe. But calling it illegal to discriminate against a guy for preaching 9/11 trutherism and Sandy Hook crisis actor nonsense?  I don't see it happening.\n",

But it's just as intellectually lazy to say \"*freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequence*,\" and equally idiotic.   Because it's a roundabout justification of punishing offensive speech.   It's the result of looking at freedom of speech as a *strict idea*, rather than a principle to live by.   \"*I'll fight to the death for your right to speak, even if I disagree*\" was never meant to be appended with, \"*but if I disagree I'll punch you for being a fucking Nazi, no freedom from consequences, you fucking bigot!*\"\n",

In real life, I'd give you a \"Shut the fuck up, u/Cetarial, that's annoying.\" I wouldn't punch you.   I'd try to talk to you about it, like this. If someone said you should be punched, punished, or imprisoned for what you'd said, I'd tell them to fuck off, possibly with force.   Because I'll defend your right to speak even if I disagree.  If your right to speak shifted into, *actually trying to*  >Gas the jews, kill all faggots, death to sandniggers,  It would be time for the punishment to start rolling.   -----  I guess this is a lot of rambling to say, \"Most people that discuss *'not freedom from consequence'* are using it to try to **silence** those they disagree with.\" It goes against the entire principle of freedom of speech.   And you know what? Maybe after a few too many late night parties where u/Cetarial came over to my house and spouted his \"gas the jews\" schtick, I'd tell them they weren't welcome anymore.  And that *would* be a consequence, because, like I said above, balance is critical. But as a rule, I'm hesitant to start censoring, de-platforming, and all that because it is a slippery slope.\n",

      "2. \tLet's bring it back to the gaming aspect for a moment. (Disclaimer, the following response is not to the guy I am responding to, but to the mindset of the writer in a specific situation.)  \"I enjoy videogames, but I'm not good at it and I don't want to be\"  Alright then. Here's a simple advice: Do. Not. Play. Multiplayer. At all. Play Singleplayer games that are narrative driven and have a good time. Proudly select the lowest difficulty. Cheat like there is no tomorrow. Make it fun for you, because singleplayer is ALL about you. Multiplayer isn't. If you do not want to shoot for greatness, if you do not want to become better at it, do not play multiplayer. Especially not with that attitude. If you \"do not want to be good\" at it, you are Dead Weight for your team. You make things worse for way more people than just little ol' yourself. You WILL get shit. Same as a guy who, for example, during a group project would do fuck all, then lose the data he was asked to get and claim that the whole thing was his idea in the first place when it comes to presenting it, you will get a nice variation of \"fuck you, fuck your face, fuck your attitude and get fucked by the horse you rode in on you fuck\". Do not expect a pat on the head, a cookie and a participation trophy for ruining the fun of other people. You do NOT matter more than them and not giving the best you got and not actively trying to get better is an insult to your team. If you want to matter, and not have to get good, singleplayer is there for you. There are loads of guides on the net (google-fu is your friend), there are trainers, cheats, instructions, videos, maps, step by step solutions, you can always find a solution. But even in singleplayer games, depending on the game, the answer will sometimes be \"Get Better\". That game then might not be for you. And there is loads of games of any skill floor and ceiling out there, all you have to do is pick one.\n",
      "3. \t\t> because singleplayer is ALL about you  To a degree yes.I would say: \"It's OK you can make single player games all about you\".  Why I make this pedantic distinction?  'Cos without it we later get articles like: \" `VIDEOGAME_NAME` is to hard for me, and that's a bad thing\".  Where `VIDEOGAME_NAME` is a single player title like bloodborne, anything from the Souls series or Cuphead.  I say \"you can make\" 'cos the player can do all modern technology allows you to tune your experience. But if the developer wanted to limits their efforts to balanced, fair, challenging mechanics, that's ok too. No one owns you an easy mode unless that was advertised.\n",
      "4. \t\t\tThat's what I was adressing in the last part, where some games just won't be fun to some person. It's like cooking. Some people enjoy having their tongue chemically peeled by extremely spicey food, others think that freshly cooked water (after cooling down again, naturally) is a rather wild ride and just barely something they can handle.

      "5. \t\tI guess if the MP has bots, it would be fine, but most games don't have bots to play MP modes with. Which is a bummer for me.

The problem with the argument that illegal immigrants are bringing violence to this country is that immigrants who arrive to this country to commit violence never stay.  They get deported then find their way back to our country again and again and again. The ones who landscape our backyards, fix our roofs, serve you your McDonald's breakfast and coffee and clean up your home are not the criminals, that is not their intention.  They just heard about the American dream and they want a piece of it if you want to call that a crime.  The ones who really want to commit crime don't want to stay here.  They come here to do what they need to do and go back to their corrupt country. I'm not defending this girl, she did commit a crime.  She is hardly a career criminal though and while she got a slap on the wrist it's not like she physically hurt anybody.  Material goods were stolen and returned and some sort of punishment was rendered.  The financial stipend was relative to her ability to earn. Think about all the single mothers in this country who get financial aid.  She most certainly wasn't getting that otherwise I imagine she wouldn't have felt like she had to steal jewelry from her place of work.\n",

Someone at google updated the code for the most used function on their (probably) third most used service worldwide to make it unnecessarily invoke two expensive translation operations and modify user comments to make it appear they said things that are more politically correct without notifying them, nobody caught it through multiple code reviews or QA, and it got rolled public accidentally.  One is a display issue. Someone at google failed to hide from the user in some cases that his comment was modified.  Just in the face of it I know which is more likely. But then you add in context, all the shenanigans on other platforms about banning, shadowbanning, quarantining, and spezzing, and it starts to paint a picture.\n",

It can very well be user error as well (for example use Translate in Chrome and it just breaks tons of stuff).   No, you're just making things up on the basis that you don't like YT and Google.  And here is the thing - I don't like them either - but there is enough to blame them for without any reasonable doubt - one does not need to spun conspiracy that could very well be just bug - esp. given the fact translate can output that same phrase.

If you don't think those represent bugs, what is your argument besides 'google intends to misrepresent a user's comments in a way that may materially change their meaning in some way that isn't clear under some circumstances that aren't clear.'  And yes, it's fair that it might be user error. But with google's track record, their business with censorious entities, and the context of various social media company events lately, I consider it just as likely that this is them flubbing something as it is to be user error. He also may be lying. In which case, hah-hah, he got me. But I will remain suspicious of google as well.\n",

The focus was on preparing students to be able to apply theory, test it, and explain it while giving them some real world skills that could get them jobs.

Originally when #metoo first started I tried to explain to a guy friend that these things do happen to women, but soon after I stopped defending it. It clearly became a political tool, aimed at hurting others rather than defending/helping women.  Kavanaugh case was just ridiculous. I don't understand that people were so eager to jump on him and ruin his career. They traumatized this man and his family... for what? Not is it just that I didn't see any evidence, but watching Ford and her questionable body language made me even more suspicious. Why was she trying to \"act cute\"? Either Democrats took advantage of a mentally disturbed woman or this was a politically plot. In any case, it's very unfair. As women though, we do see that leftists are just using us and we are walking away.\n",

I recently (trial finished in August) had my family nearly torn apart by a sexual assault case between two minors one being a close relative of my wife's and the other being a close relative of mine.  We were forced to be smack dab in the middle of the whole thing.  It was dismissed with great prejudice, but I know first hand the destructive force of these types of accusations.  My wife and I were newlywed and expecting our now 10 month old daughter when the charges were first brought up.  Even still the effects are felt.  Some aspects of my family will never, ever be the same.  I get pretty mad at blatantly false accusations.  \n",

I think a lot of female supporters of #metoo movement and feminism just follow the emotional reaction thinking those people speak for women's interests. However, intimidation and accusations are not the right way to bring change. All they do is create resistance and turn both sides against each other. Men are not going to be more respectful because they're scared, that stems from personal values. They're going to be more bitter and see women as a liability.

I honestly believe he wanted to touch her. The claim was that he put his hands in her pants and the footage doesn't show her pants or what his hands did down there.

From what I've seen of reality style police shows from the US the police approach vehicles with their hand on their holster and leave it there while talking to the driver. That changes the entire dynamic of the interaction and far from keeping the officer safe it actually raises the temperature of the situation and makes a negative outcome more likely. \n",

You honestly think there's a viewing market for watching cops pull over little old ladies to tell them they have a burnt out signal bulb? Of course not.  Secondly, what is happening in the US is more of a result of an agenda-driven media looking to keep the public on edge through pandering to the more ignorant of the viewing masses by exaggerating tensions between groups with opposing social structures. Utilizing fear, anger, and misinformation, much of the public and some members of law enforcement see the other as inherently evil, dangerous, and untrustworthy.

      "2. \tI would say if she'd do meth we wouldn't have to deal with her anymore.  Then again my brother's pyscho (possibly a more stupid zoe like) did a decent amount of meth and didn't remove her blight from the earth. At least the courts around here won't put up with her bullshit. The problem is they keep letting her out. She's been in and out of jail for years now. Maybe this time they'll keep her in or put her in a place for the criminally insane.  She's so much of a lying cunt, that the *VERY FIRST TIME* I spoke with her myself on a phone call- I think something about her and my brother's daughter that every word I heard from her sounded so fake and dipping with falsehoods that I wanted to be able to throttle her through the headset.  Sadly due to but genetics of her pyschoness my brother's seeming sociopathy(but not very abusive about it) and her being in and out of foster, she's about to be an adult before long and I assume she will be just as much as a walking disaster who makes everyone in her life suffer. It saddens me. She was a amazingly well behaved baby- but then again she was around her mother too much, my brother didn't really give much of a fuck, and we couldn't take care of her besides infrequently.  I wonder, if someone who wasn't her cunt mother or random foster care raised her if she could have turned out okay. I guess we will never know.  I'm gonna stop thinking about this before I start reaching for the booze.\n",

I thought about getting some bourbon but as much as the taste is fine it seems to numb my mouth pretty fast. Yay autistically sensitive.. well senses.  Maybe I should get some and mix it in stuff. Sweet tea maybe?  Also I did that cause I'm cheap, and a buddy of mine said it was good. Though he told me when I have my opinion to it.  \"I think you have an unrealistic exception of alcohol. Apple cider is not going to taste like apple juice+ additional alcohol.\"  It wasn't too bad though. It wasn't fucking beer. I don't much care for beer. It's the taste at the back of a swig, or a sip. I think that's the hops? It makes me think of coffee and the bitter taste at the back of it no matter how much shit you do to that coffee. Though mikes or this cider I an stand, though I could taste the lemon more in mikes than the apple in this.  <shrugs>  Besides I may go back to sleep and I probably shouldn't drink right before doing that. Maybe I'll be wrong, maybe my niece will have a good life- or at least the kind of meh life I have without having children she didn't want(not me more like my brother) and then emotionally abuses or shit.  While some people(debatedly deservedly) on kojima's writing there is one line in MGS4 that struck profoundly with me.  (Gonna obfuscate it even though it's a bit old for spoilers sake)  You have an old man in a graveyard staring death in the face looking at a grave of his mentor.  \"I didn't understand what she meant at the time, but she told me that living a good life isn't about changing the world- it isn't about making things 'better', it's about not making the world any worse than it was before you entered into it, when you finally leave it.\"  This is a *fundamental* problem with the understanding of people like SJWs. Unless there is a massive current problem starring you in the face. Stop trying to \"fix\" everything. You will likely just make it worse. Stop changing things that don't need changing. You are making your existence upon this planet, your entry into the experiment that is mortal life, a net negative for everyone else- and possibly even yourself. People NEED far more discipline and humility than they tend to currently possess. I probably have too much and it turns into a kind of self loathing.  These people *are* fuck ups because they never stop and reflect, and ask if they might be making a mistake. I constantly ask myself if I'm doing the wrong thing. I never ask myself \"you know you might be doing the right thing\"\n",

And all that matters is keeping your hands on the wheel just enough to keep the car driving straight. If that car is just you driving home, or you are driving an entire bus full of people.

Some societies tolerate a version of it. Others will eliminate all signs of it with extreme prejudice.  A \"government\" is an entity that has a (de facto) monopoly on force within a geographical area. Once corporations grow beyond a certain size and gain the ability to influence the politics of not just villages and towns, but states and nation states, **they need to be regulated, broken up, or, if nothing else works, nationalized.**  When you think of free markets and libertarianism, don't think of some heavenly utopia. Instead, think of Negan and his club.\n",
      "2. \t>When you think of free markets and libertarianism, don't think of some heavenly utopia. Instead, think of Negan and his club.  Bullshit. Negan is the definition of a totalitarian government: rule through force and terror, instead of rule of law.  The easiest way to tell someone has no idea what libertarianism actually is is when they begin to make the argument that we need to empower people to institute beatings, lest morale continue to plummet.\n",
      "3. \t\tI would argue that a pure libertarianism has no choice but to fall into a tyrannical regime.  When everyone is free to do anything within their ablity, the strongest will simply take from all others.  It inherently devolves into \"might makes right\"  The only way to solve that is to normalize \"might\" away from the individual...\n",

Then, even if they did let you in when you were short that $0.05, they wouldn't have let you use your cup anyway after you caused a big stink about not being able to use it. Why? Because they care more about long-term profits over the short term of losing what probably amounted to a less than a dollar of product.

A funded initiative to either add or replace males in the video game workplace or in video games themselves. Gears of War 5 is part of this initiative, which is why JD was replaced as the lead in the upcoming game for Kait, and it was even featured on the #SheTalksGames panel (which is part of the Women In Gaming initiative) at this year's E3.  &#x200B;  Here's the message from Facebook:  [https://www.facebook.com/business/m/women-in-gaming](https://www.facebook.com/business/m/women-in-gaming)  &#x200B;  Here's the panel from E3:  [https://youtu.be/HFvpOXaZxOo](https://youtu.be/HFvpOXaZxOo)  &#x200B;  A dev from Take Two Interactive sent us some stuff to inform us that Hangar 13 also joined the Women In Gaming initiative, and their upcoming project (according to the dev) has characters/themes based around social justice:  [https://i.imgur.com/DRaDoGz.png](https://i.imgur.com/DRaDoGz.png)  &#x200B;  Anyone who joins in on the initiative from Facebook is basically advocating for the same kind of agenda-pushing that Sarkeesian was doing, just on a corporate level instead of a community level.  &#x200B;  Also, Microsoft's latest Avatar re-launch was entirely based around creating non-binary characters. There have been various complaints about it because it's nearly impossible to make masculine males and all of the features are themed around creating \"inclusive\" characters:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60DlYV8oTIw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60DlYV8oTIw)  &#x200B;  Phil Spencer is also of the belief that being a white male makes you privileged, which is why they're going all in on their diversity initiative and joined up with the Women In Gaming agenda:  [https://youtu.be/BQZETTIxgEU?t=1329](https://youtu.be/BQZETTIxgEU?t=1329)  &#x200B;\n",

      "17. \t\t\t\t\t\tChanging Gears of War from a story about a bunch of tough dudes trying to survive impossible odds against a seemingly unstoppable force of gruesome monster set in the action-horror genre, to a story about a young woman's journey through self-discovery seems pretty evident that it's already affected the first-party studio culture.   Also if you watch the panel with Phil Spencer he talks about putting more POCs/marginalized people in managing positions, and starting workshops to bring more diversity to the Xbox division. He's also trying to get more women into managing positions within the company.   If it were lip service without action I would agree with you, but the fact that they've already completely overhauled the Xbox avatars to focus more on fringe features (missing arms, missing legs, obese people, non-binary clothing/accessories) and changed Gears 5 to placate feminists seems to indicate they've already drunk the kool-aid. How much? I don't know, we'll have to see what's become of Crackdown 3 and Halo: Infinite. \n",
      "18. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tI wanna believe phil has just taken a few sips, unlike sony who seems to have just chugged down a whole pitcher. Besides why not try a different angle with gears 5? As long as its actually good.\n",
      "19. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEA/DICE are trying that angle with BFV and it doesn't seem to be going so great.   Besides, the core demographic for Gears has historically been college males of the dudebro type. I don't know of a single game franchise that abandoned its core demographic and managed to sell more catering to a demographic who doesn't typically buy third-person shooters (young adult females). They tried toning down the series with Gears of War 4, making it more of a family-adventure than an action-thriller and even that didn't go well for them, since it took them a year to sell what Gears of War 3 made in a week.  But if they think they can attract a bunch of female gamers by turning Gears into a story about female empowerment, all the more power to them. I'll just keep a spot free on the Get Woke/Go Broke master list if things don't turn out well for them.\n",
      "20. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVery good reasoning, i shall take the same approach as well, but wait to see how crackdown 3 and Halo Infinite do. Should those fail then i can safely say without hesitation that the gaming market has been divided between Sony/Microsoft and Nintendo/Valve.\n",

Honestly I always thought the old eddie was kind of a pussy and a really one note villain, as was venom just all rah rah rah kill the spiderman he ruined my life! you know?   this version imo had a lot more depth and character as an investigative journalist. and tom hardy is pretty likeable in general.   besides I never even knew venom ate people or killed the host before this movie. so I don't see him as a pussy. just cause he's curious about a lot of stuff on earth and wanted to talk to his new friend (that he's kind of bonded to and helpless without. not totally there are always more hosts but he and eddie are tight now)   I thought it was hilarious honestly. venom isn't supposed to be some ruthless psychopath that kills indiscriminately imo. you're thinking carnage and that's exactly why venom usually teams up with spiderman to stop him.   and carnage will be in the sequel so no worries there mate. you'll get your serial killer symbiote. \n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t> venom isn't supposed to be some ruthless psychopath that kills indiscriminately imo  He's not in the comics, he's an anti-hero who's got a grudge against Spiderman for screwing him over, Brock has a similar motivation and as a result they fuse and their desire for vengeance fuels them. Venom isn't supposed to be this heroic incarnation they've stuck together from spare parts. He's supposed to be self interested and only sides with Spiderman out of convenience. In this film he's basically just a hero trying to save the world for selfless reasons.  The movie should've been R as well considering the amounts of violence in the comics, Venom is supposed to literally eat people's heads. It doesn't even really matter if you don't want to be totally devoted to aligning with comic lore but they've departed so much from the subject matter that they've essentially made an entirely new thing that's hardly like Venom in the comics.  How do they play this off anyway with more Venom comics? Do they just ignore this movie and keep making the same thing or do they decide they're going to ignore 34 years of comics involving the interplay between Spiderman and Venom in favor of this Sony amalgamation? Probably the former. So when some kid goes and tries to get a Venom comic because he liked the movie he's either going to be confused or annoyed, possibly both.  Venom is a pussy because he's said to be one in the movie, he admits that he's one of the weaker symbiotes. In the comics (and the TV show for that matter) he's basically one of a few of Spiderman's arch-nemeses as a result of his past host with Spiderman, allowing him to give his host the powers of Spiderman and prevent Spiderman from detecting Venom with his spider sense. Also depending on which host you're talking about Venom is either weaker than some other Symbiotes or much stronger. Hell even Eddie Brock once fought and beat Superman in a crossover comic and still held his own when Superman and Spiderman worked together. Venom even fought on even footing with Juggernaut.   This also divorces the Venom lore from the very recent comics involving Knull which is a whole other thing altogether.  The real reason they made this shit movie is Sony needed to churn something out so they keep a hold on a bit of their Marvel licenses that they haven't let lapse.\n",

      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tYeah, but strange has pretty steadily been seen as a negative word. And there are plenty of ways to convey its meaning without the negative connotations, for instance “outlier”, “outside the norm”, etc.\n",
      "9. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t> doesn't mean retarded isn't accurate just because the word has baggage.  Come now.   Plenty of words have changed their meaning, mate.    You probably don't use \"gay\" to mean 'happy' but rather 'homosexual'.   You probably don't use \"awful\" to mean something 'amazing' but rather something 'horrible'.   You probably don't use \"fantastic\" to mean something 'imagined/unreal' but something 'amazing'.  To pretend that language doesn't evolve and live is plain silly.   Some words become negative, some positive. If you choose to use an outdated term that is offensive, well, don't be surprised if people don't react positively to you and your antiquated ways.\n",
      "10. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf some words become positive, getting offended by the new meaning is also latching on to antiquated ways. Some people cling to old insults and insist on being offended. Moron use to be a medical term. Then it was deemed offensive and now people just use it to mean dumb person. The same thing happened to the word retard but people seem to be holding on to it as very insulting. \n",
      "11. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnically, yes.  But sometimes a baggage is so big that it's very difficult to get away from its shadow. In some cases it takes years, if not decades.   Sometimes being tactful is more important than being technically correct.\n",
      "12. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas an avid bibliophile who learned to read with Tolkien and other dead old white men, i do use all those words with both meanings. but yeah, in general, your're right.\n",
      "13. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHence \"probably\".  But know that you will confuse people if you use words with their old meaning.  But fair fair, as long as you know what you're doing, you do you.  All the best.\n",
      "14. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tI wouldn't use \"strange\" or \"abnormal\" in this situation. I get that its technically accurate but in context here it kinda implies \"unnatural\" which isn't the case. It comes off a bit rude.\n",

I guess you will shoot this down by saying \"Ha! but this change also benefits women! They are allowed to have careers, independent incomes etc\". Which is totally missing the point.   This is what is meant by the idea that feminism is about fostering true equality (note: NOT identical-ness) between the sexes. It isn't about making \"real world changes\" designed to specifically lift one sex while holding the other back*. It's about getting away from the idea that it should be an us/them situation in the first place, and getting rid of behaviours that hold BOTH sexes back.   *Unless by \"holding back\" you mean feminist-led/inspired movements such as \"#metoo\" are persecuting or limiting men's freedoms by asking them not to sexually harass or abuse women, or passing laws like the ones that criminalised rape within marriage were persecuting men for not letting them rape their wives any more.

      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\t>That you willingly subsume yourself to help an ideology that hates you and wants you dead is troubling, to say the least. Take care of yourself, you deserve better.  Just another example of muddled (or perhaps just lack of) thinking on the subject. Ideologies don't \"want people dead\". They aren't conscious beings with \"wants\". Perhaps that's all that's going on here - you haven't really thought about this at all properly, you just don't like all those serious women making points about society/gender issues when you just want to play games. And somewhere along the line you've picked up the idea that there's an \"ideology\" out there called feminism, and somehow it is sentient and wants you dead. If that's it, then fine - I completely see what the issue is here. I don't agree with the way you see the world, but I respect your right to express your opinion about it here. And we can leave it at that.    Perhaps it's more than that though - maybe that statement was just your somewhat clumsy attempt at saying that \"the people who believe in this ideology want me (all men, I presume) dead\". In which case I have to take issue. First you would have to define what you meant by \"the people who believe in this ideology.\" Presumably - you mean feminists. But what do you mean by a feminist? Because I've already given my definition (which happens to match with the dictionary definition, and just about every online definition I can find) that a feminist is someone who believes men and women deserve to be treated equally in society. But I assume you have a different definition, as that doesn't seem to match with the idea of them hating me and wanting me dead.  Most of the people I know in real life are feminists. My family all call themselves feminists. Most of the people who I admire in public life, I either know are feminists because they have said so, or I can infer from their words and actions that they live by feminist principles (working towards a society where everyone has equal rights).  I asked one of my niece's 18 year old friends the other day if she considered herself a feminist. She's never heard me talk about gender issues and I've never called myself a feminist in front of her. Her immediate answer was, \"Well, like, yeah, of course I am...\" followed by looking at me like it would be stupid to assume anything else. I was heartened by that, as some of the stuff I'd been reading online (generally all from anti-feminist sources, like this sub, for example) had made me think that perhaps it wasn't such an obvious question these days for a lot of people.  Anyway I'm rambling a bit, but my point is, these people don't want me killed, and they don't hate me. Maybe there are some very fringe, radical feminists with a genuine, non-ironic \"kill all men\" outlook, but I've never, ever , in 40 years of moving amongst people who in the vast majority of cases call themselves feminist, met a single one.  \n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t>A lack  of thinking on the subject  Then you proceed to strawman. Funny how that works.  >in 40 years of moving amongst feminists, I've not met a single misandrist  Anecdotes aren't data. Look at the founders of feminist rhetoric, they're all misandrists. In the west it is the default to be \"feminist\" and believe that feminists believe in equality between men and women. This does not mean this is the truth however. Large amounts of people frequently believe things that are false. The people who want equality between men and women are egalitarians. That you've apparently spent 40 years moving through this world and have yet to pick that up makes me worry for you.  \n",
      "9. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSo in the west it is default to be feminist (agreed, in my experience) and yet feminists still hate and want to kill all men? That seems to be self-evidently not true. The feeling among people who follow the \"default\" on the issue is that they hate men and want them dead? Why are there not waves of feminist-inspired murders on a daily basis?  \"Large amounts of people frequently believe things that are false\" - Have you considered this might apply to anti-feminists, who make claims such as \"feminists hate and want to kill all men\", when, as I have explained above, that clearly isn't true of the majority of people who call themselves feminists?\n",
      "10. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t> So in the west it is default to be feminist (agreed, in my experience)  It's not. That's why only roughly 20% of people identify as feminist. the fact that you think it's the default shows exactly how much of an echo chamber you've surrounded yourself with.  >and yet feminists still hate and want to kill all men?  Of course feminism hates men, feminism has a heavy element of penis envy.   >That seems to be self-evidently not true.  It self evidently IS true, at least in the hatred of men part of the statement, as you can see from the large amount of concrete changes that it's made to the law in which it tries to deny men basic rights, while constantly giving it's own in-group rights, absent of obligations.  As for wanting to kill men, the only person who has made that argument here is well, you. Which means you are straw manning what is being said again.  Now when you are ready, how about you answer that question: Name one real world concrete change made by feminism as a social movement, made for the strict benefit of men, for the specific purpose of equality. \n",
      "11. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t> Just another example of muddled (or perhaps just lack of) thinking on the subject. Ideologies don't \"want people dead\".   Yes, yes they do. An ideology is just a series of ideas, so if a series of ideas contains the following concept  1. The German people are superior.  2. The Jewish people are inferior, a plague on the lands of German Sovereignty  3. The Jews should be exterminated wherever they are found  Then yes, that series of ideas does in fact want the Jews dead. \n",

I think many of these people chose not to get help when they were of sounder mind, and should be punished for the exact same reasons.  mental illness is still a deeply taboo subject, and plenty of people prefer to avoid inpatient psychiatric wards because, let’s be real, those places are hell on earth.  that and there are lasting complications from diagnoses.  even if you take your meds regularly and have never had problems, nearly every employer will probably turn you down from a job because of the diagnosis, even though you’ve never had an insane episode and have a perfect record.  it’s understandable that people are sometimes unable to be aware that they aren’t taking medication, and are mostly rejected by society for a flaw in how they were born.  you don’t blame a dog for peeing on the carpet when it’s only ever peed on carpets - that’s it’s whole experience and all it knows.  you understand where the dog comes from and work with it to achieve a better result.  as i’ve already said, this doesn’t excuse the crimes committed, and they do receive punishment for it.  but downplaying actual mental illness or saying that people choose to be mentally is just fucked.\n",

He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.  > Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance.

The coverage on Breitbart I checked so far (I did not read all their articles, I only looked at a few) has warped and changed meanings in several places. These are close enough that the sources provided seem to substantiate them, yet if you check the whole manual or look at the evidence provided critically you'll see it's either misleading or false in several places:  Example 1: Breitbart: Trump, Conspiracy Theorist - [One of the reasons Google identifies for allegedly widespread public disillusionment with internet free speech is that it “breeds conspiracy theories.”](http://archive.is/eHJTD#selection-549.0-553.151)  Actual context: In [The Good Censor](https://www.scribd.com/document/390521673/The-Good-Censor-GOOGLE-LEAK) this slide is at the end of the section \"What’s the role of the tech firms in all of this?\", with previous slides detailing how tech firms are mismanaging the issues. Under this context the beginning of the slide \"When it comes to users, all of this bad behaviour and mismanagement...\" and then end \"... breeds conspiracy theories\" has a completely different meaning. Not that internet free speech is breeding conspiracy theories (as Breitbart says), but that the mismanagement of the companies (being intransparent about their algorithms and behavior) breeds such conspiracy stories by removing the ability from people to verify or falsify them easily.   (I have to leave now, so only one example for now, I'll edit more in later).  3.) In regards to the twitter reply by Bokhari you can see similar methods used. What is said is close to the truth in order to possibly mislead when not accurately checking, but false if you actually do check. One simple example here as well directly in the first tweet:   >A few self-described \"centrists\" (who unlike Evil Partisans, are unbiased, non-tribal, always correct and never wrong) have decided The Good Censor is fake news. Ironically, they base this claim on a video that spreads horrendous fake news in its first 5 minutes.  Besides the \"centrist\" point as /u/psa_sitch pointed out (but which can be forgiven as some self-proclaimed centrists retweeted it), this is also a false statement. None of them claimed \"The Good Censor\" is fake news, they claimed that Breitbarts reporting of the story is false, biased or misleading. \n",

If he arrested you for that, then you could, legally, physically fight him off, even if it results in his death. There are plenty of legal precedents to back this up. Unlawful arrest is the exact same thing as kidnapping, and is very, very illegal.  Cops are not always right, and you do not always have to do what they say, but that doesn't mean they won't continue to break the law (and get away with it) by physically assaulting you and arresting you anyways; but that doesn't make them right.\n",
      "3. \t\tYeah but this isn't serious and in no way constitutes unlawful arrest. The woman was drunk, angry and unstable, plus she was warned AND given several opportunities to back off \\- I think she deserved a night in the tank.\n",
      "4. \t\t\tHe basically told her that she can't be in a public space, which, as far as I know, he can't legally do.   https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/20/rights-during-police-encounters/14299485/  Read the first scenario in this link. It says that the order to leave a public area is not necessarily a lawful command that you have to follow. Since that is the case, he very well may have committed an unlawful arrest, which, by law, is the same thing as kidnapping, and you are allowed to kill the cop. I understand fully that you would be in a world of shit, but, since it is all video recorded, you should/could/would get off eventually (assuming non-corrupt judges and such).  http://www.constitution.org/uslaw/defunlaw.htm\n",
      "5. \t\t\t\tThere's a difference between standing in a public area being chill and being drunk as fuck and shouting and getting in a cop's face while he's trying to sort shit out because, you know, he has a job to do. She wasn't standing and watching, she was trying to involve herself and he told her many times what the consequences would be if she didn't stop trying. The thing that was so funny about this one was that he gave her so many chances and yet she still couldn't just swallow her pride.  He has the power, I would assume, to prevent members of the public interfering with a police investigation, don't you think?\n",
      "6. \t\t\t\t\tWell, I think there is a pretty large line between telling a 90 pound drunk girl to leave and having to slam her to the floor for not leaving.   He pushed her away then arrested her for telling him to not (illegally) put his hands on her. He never told her what she is under arrest for, and never read her any Miranda Rights; that is an unlawful arrest in many jurisdictions, and you can literally kill a cop for that, as stated by plenty of legal precedence. The slam to the floor was absolutely excessive, which is illegal in any jurisdiction. Also, in any jurisdiction, a cop must witness you commit a crime, or have reasonable suspicion that you have committed a crime. She had not committed any crime aside from not moving on from the public space when told to. That does not warrant a slam to the floor.  The cop did things wrong and needlessly escalated the situation. I mean, if his goal was to impress everyone there by showing his huge ~~penis~~ authority, then mission accomplished, but otherwise, he fucked up. He'll still get away with it, because people (and cthe courts) are stupid, but he's still an asshole. If I was her lawyer, I'd have him ~~fired~~ on paid vacation (sad face).   The incels on this sub love this stuff though \"woman brutally slammed to the floor for asking what she did wrong, heh, stupid women!\"  All that being said, though, I do recognize that we live in a police state, and the courts will absolutely uphold his right to slam a 90 pound girl to the concrete for not \"moving on\" when told to do so. I'm unhappy about this police state. Are you? Can you swallow *your* pride long enough to recognize that this was pretty damn excessive and completely unnecessary on the cop's part?\n",
      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\tShe put her hands on him. He's got a gun in his holster, he doesn't know what she's planning to do. He told her to fuck off, she didn't, end of story. Look I'm not saying he's a model policeman, but when I see this video I can see many times where this girl could have saved herself the trouble of getting slammed. Cops are unpredictable, especially American cops, and she put her hand on his vest. WTF did she expect? It would only be excessive if he hadn't given her many, many verbal warnings. After a point he just said thought \"fuck it, if she isn't gonna take the hint, I'm gonna have to end this.\" If she had done nothing I'd completely sympathise, but she acted like an idiot and won a stupid prize. I reiterate that if this was a dude, no one would give a shit.\n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shows a fundamental difference in views. I don't think that girl did anything to deserve a slam; the cop could have very easily restrained her without slamming.  You think a 90 lb girl needs to be slammed on the floor for putting her hands on a human. He *actually* slammed her when she asked him 'what the fuck she did', not from putting her hands on him. It was very excessive, and completely unnecessary; any human without a woman-hating agenda can clearly see this.\n",
      "9. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou have actually changed my mind somewhat. Although I still think he was right to arrest her, but yeah when I watch it back it was pretty extreme. the cop would have won the day if he'd just put her in cuffs. \n",

      "11. \t\t\tFunny story; I got randomly stopped walking down the street once, and the cops searched me (against my will), found some weed, and they ticketed me for it (even though I had a legal doctor's recommendation). The judge dropped any charges and said the cop's didn't have the right to search me *or* take my weed. Judge order them to give back my weed, but it was mysteriously nowhere to be found. Haha.  But yeah, I hated cops *long* before then. ... Asshole. ;-)\n",
      "12. \t\t\t\tAnd by the way. A hatred of cops means a hatred of authority. You get a hatred for authority by not being brought up properly by your parents as they are the natural authority figure on your life growing up. Not being properly taught values at a young age leads to people like you. You see cops effectively like your parents and you go into a child like state when you have dealings with them.

A blind acceptance of every authority figure arises from not having a proper father figure in your life. Not having a proper father figure leads you to have daddy issues, which leads to your love affair with the big, masculine cops.  I pity your mom for having raised such a beta male, I'm praying to every known god that your children get cancer and die slow, horribly painful deaths so that your lineage dies with you. No one loves you.\n",
      "14. \t\t\t\t\t\tYou are delusional. You get bad cops of course. But to think that the core is corrupt or totalitarian is actually mental. Like seriously. I think you've been smoking too much weed buddy as you're thoughts are completely irrational. I'm not going to even argue the point. Do you think the earth is flat too?  Respecting authority is a good trait. The police are the good guys. They put bad people in prison. They make the world a safer place. Without cops the world would be in literal chaos. What do you do?  Just bum around smoking weed doing absolutely nothing with your pathetic existence.  You should be glad there are cops. Honestly if there was no law or cops, you'd be dead. Youre a complete cunt and would have been murdered.   You know deep down that your parents are fucked up and you had a bad childhood. I don't need to argue the point. You can act all tough on the internet, but some little pot head, waste of space doesn't bother me at all. You are literally a drain on human resources and offer absolutely nothing to society. \n",
      "15. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tCops are trained to be totalitarian... it's literally their job. They want your complete subservience to 'the state'. You are suffering from something called the Just-World Fallacy. That states that good guys all get rewarded and only the bad guys ever get punished. It is incredibly childish and naive to think this way, and your mom did you a great dis-service by teaching you this. Prepare for a life of disappointment and being taken advantage of, kid.  Have you been paying no attention to the news at all? Cops are caught being corrupt all the time... entire police departments are caught being corrupt. *You* are the delusional one if you seriously think cops are the good guys. They have this thing called the 'Blue Code of Silence' or the 'Blue Shield' where they feel that they are at war with the entire population, and they have to cover for each other. Not even making this shit up. You've heard of \"one rotten apple ruins the whole barrel\"? Well, the police force is a rotten barrel that ruins all the apples. Cops are so corrupt it hurts. Everything from planting drugs to making speed traps to pay for their overtime (yeah, cops get paid a ton of overtime for appearing in traffic court... high incentive for them to abuse their powers and write lots and lots of tickets...) on top of the department getting a ton of funds from them; some small towns make millions of dollars a year on illegal speed traps. Short videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpt8-HcEYy8   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ14ng8pGgs   Entire departments are in on this, and if you think it stops there, then your mom raised an even bigger moron than I thought.  Ever head the saying \"power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely\"? Well, due to dumb, dickless, dipshits like you, cops have absolute power, which means they are absolutely corrupt. They shoot innocent, unarmed people in their own homes and don't get in trouble for it. They shoot innocent, unarmed people in broad daylight in public and don't get in trouble for it. They get caught lying or planting evidence and their boss gives them a paid vacation. You have to be an utter moron to still trust the police, with all the evidence we have of them being corrupt. If most cops were not corrupt, don't you think they would have squashed all the corrupt ones by now? A little logic would tell you that since corruption is so prevalent, then it must be the case that the majority, or at least a very significantly large minority, of them are corrupt. They accept bribes and knockbacks. They lie and plant evidence, they falsify reports. The tradition of police corruption has been there since the beginning of America, pitting anti-vice vs vice for profit.  If you ever manage to leave your mom's basement, you may have an encounter with them one day. You probably will change your mind about them at that point.  What do *I* do? I'm a sound technician. I get paid a lot of money to work with rock stars and play rock and roll; I tour the country and get free things given to me because people like me. What do *you* do, kid? Sit around by yourself playing video games? Updating your Pokemon collection? Nice. I'm glad that your kids (if you ever lose your virginity and have some) are gonna die of cancer, that way, your complacent, willful ignorance won't get passed down to corrupt the next generation. I hope your eyes stop working and your asshole develops taste buds. Get fucked, kid. Better yet, what's your address? I'm gonna come fuck your mom.\n",

I think deconstructions and breaking down the character types work better when they are the minority of the trend, not the way where you need to focus on the weaknesses of the heroes now to make them feel like more human. Also I'm with Razörfist on the belief that people are really craving for strong and or idealistic characters to return such as The Shadow or Solomon Kane. I'd say that's one of the reasons why characters like Punisher, Doomguy and Goblin Slayer are popular in the West at the moment.\n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\thell i think the problem now is that people forget you have to reconstruct the deconstruction.  like from what i understand deconstructions push tropes and trends to their logical conclusions to show the flaws and thus show a new take and proper criticism of a cliche.  you then have to fix those flaws and basically make the trope cool and sensical again.   i think it's one reason the MCU is a billion dollar franchise now outside of just being well crafted entertianment.  they actually embrace the weird and wonderful kitchen sink kitchen which is superhero comics that have both magic and superscience, gods and aliens extra-dimensional entities and ancient races all coexisting in a somewhat coherent framework.  if the original X-men films and the Nolan Batman trilogy made superheroes serious and grounded the MCU made them fun and fantastic :D  an example is how they reconstructed the deconstruction of colorful costumes where all movie supers had boring black leather for \"practicality\".  Captain America got his star spangled suit because after being given the serum he got hired as a mascot for the war effort complete with bright and goofy 1940's spandex.  and only after he proved himself saving a bunch of soldiers from a hydra prison right after a gig and improvising a better combat suit using props from the show did he come to be respected and therefore make star-spangled spandex look good.  and iron-Man is his classic flashy red and yellow because Tony Stark is a flashy egotist who loves fanciness as well as fuctionality and treated his combat suit as a hot rod. we saw him build the suit with ease due to his genious and thus earned our respect to trust his design choices and dude has wicked sense of style :D  and i wanna say the Guardians of the Galaxy reconstructed  the classic comic book trope of aliens being a suspiciously similar substitute to human culture by having common cultural trappings like toys and t-shirts present with an alien style.  like Star Lord had a grey Tee that had some sort of slogan written in an alien script and Yandu had various little funko type figurines on his dashboard which looked like stylized versions of alien animals.  like i spotted a Dunny fig with 3 limbs and 3 ears and a Littlest Pet Shop cat with one eye.  so since those little details shown space people can develop similar cultural trends to earth people it made the more pulpy stuff like Maori flavored Gladiator games in Thor Ragnarok all the more acceptable.  guess more SJW showrunners are too busy showing how racist and sexist everything is they forgot how to make it not that anymore but actual good and interesting XD\n",

Note that the later probably made the task of timely finding alternatives significantly more difficult)  Not to claim that entirety of elections hinged on how this shooting was portrayed, but when vast majority of population is led to believe that Republican core supporters are picking up guns to mass murder them, 2 days before they can vote for their representatives, that surely had a significant effect on the outcomes.

Imagine if that crowd had started screaming that, he might have gone ahead and removed Crowder to save his own hide. The mob doesn't care if the allegations are true, it's just blood in the water.

One might rationalize this as Western journos not serving Japan-only news, but this hasn't stopped stories of similar scope before, like Japanese game announcements from Tokyo Game Show that may not necessarily get a Western release. Plus, this story very much has a relevant Western element to it, not only in that it will impact all future efforts to release Japanese games to the West, but also in that Sony's new censorious policy is being dictated by Westerners.  Looking back further, there also appears to be little coverage of the latest Senran Kagura game being delayed and censored due to the policy, the first sign of the new danger.

Is it true or not?  >Stating that the court had found that \"the applicant's statements had been likely to arouse justified indignation in Muslims\" and \"amounted to a generalization without factual basis\", the Strasbourg-based ECtHR said that the woman's comments could not be covered by the freedom of expression.  According to wikipedia there's a source that states precisely that.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad%27s_wives#Aisha_bint_Abu_Bakr  I guess wikipedia must be also breaking the law.  >The court said it \"found in particular that the domestic courts comprehensively assessed the wider context of the applicant's statements and **carefully balanced her right to freedom of expression with the right of others to have their religious feelings protected,** and served the legitimate aim of preserving religious peace in Austria.\"  this is where it hits rock bottom, people can have whatever feelings they want for whatever reasons, you shouldn't be responsible for offending those feelings specially when you're stating something that is sourced.  An example I've seen is how Galileo also suffered consequences for saying that the Earth orbited the Sun, that also helped protect people's feelings and preserve religious peace.

Over the past few months, simply logging into the game has netted me millions of GTA bucks. They have double cash promos all the time and they have giveaways all the time that simply hand you money.  Now, if you wanted to invest time into the game and actually play it then you should have enough money by the end of doing everything to buy almost everything in the game. All the DLC is end game content. It's like buying an expansion pack with virtual currency. And once you have the CEO expansion with a garage (probably $2mil investment), you can do car heists to make money. This alone makes buying shark cards for someone who doesn't have time anymore super easy. In 15 min, you can quickly make $60,000-$80,000 and more if you collect a set of cars.  Shark cards are for two people: people who want to play that don't have time but want a fancy car to run with their friends OR people who think because a new car is out, they must buy it like some completionist autistic gamer.  All the things you buy in the game for the necessity to have fun are cheap. If you need the fancy stuff, play the game as intended or spend you money.  Back in subject though: Cheating should never get you any time in jail. And what stops in-game exploits from being considered cheating later if this doesn't get a nail in the coffin?\n",

You know shit is wrong when you have literal songs about rape, about cheating on your girlfriend, about objectifying women and so on being so mainstream and normalized.

So Spider-man wouldn't fit. Infact most venom stories go without peter\n",
      "3. \t\tBut the movie is also an origin for Venom, which as far as the comics are concerned, absolutely requires Peter.  This would be like if instead of Batman losing his parents as an origin, he becomes Batman because the Joker kills Jason Todd. The continuity is fucked.\n",
      "4. \t\t\tNot exactly, the symboite finds Eddie, it just happens to be right after it comes off peter, if the symboite found Eddie regardless or could exist with another host, never coming into contact with Peter first (The event known as Venomverse from last year explore tat) what would change? According to those comics..almost nothing. The idea of Venom has evolved past that origin and his rivalary with spider-man. Heck Venom is approaching the point where he's been the anti-hero/heroic almost twice as long as he was the villain.  it'd not be like Bruce's parents being shot especially since the comics have explored venom would be venom without Peter. this is much more like how Joker has multiple choice origins, sometimes he's a guy who batman pushed into a vat, other times he's just a crazy guy who appeared out of nowhere and more recently, it was set up to make it seem like he was some supernatural being who had haunted gotham slenderman style since it's very founding. Or Jason Todd who originally was literally a copy paste of Grayson was altered into the anti-social punk who died in Death of the family.\n",
      "5. \t\t\t\tThe entire reason Eddie in 616 goes to the church where he finds the symbiote is to pray for forgiveness before he commits suicide because he feels that Peter Parker ruined his life and cost him his job. The symbiote was freshly and forcibly separated from Peter, by Peter himself. The whole reason they decide to work together in the first place is their mutual animosity for Peter, plus the symbiote also wanting to return and re-bond with Peter. Venom, in 616, would not exist as he is if not for Spider-Man. Sure, a man named Eddie Brock can bond with an alien symbiote and take the name “Venom”, but when his motivation for doing so and the circumstances behind the event in question are so radically altered, it’s practically not the same character anymore. Just because two characters share the same name doesn’t make them at all similar, case in point mainstream comic Batman and Ben Affleck cinematic Batman who wantonly murders people.  Also, I’ve read Venomverse. That series doesn’t explore what would happen if the symbiote never bonded with Peter and went straight to Eddie. Not in the main story, at least. That’s all I’ve read, never looked at any tie-ins.\n",
      "6. \t\t\t\t\tBatman use to kill under Bob Kane until the early 40s when the PTA fainting couch types said \"Superhoes shouldn't kill\". He originally was written to leave KGBeast to die in the tunnels after their fight in 1988 (Batman #420), it's only later retconning by another writer that says KGBeast was later rescued. And in Batman 425 he allows a mobster to be crushed by a pile of car. So Yeah I don't see a difference.  Now as to the idea \"it'd practically not the same character\" it kind of isn't, if you read venom now, he's got very little hatred or love for spider-man it is almost understood as a \"you leave me alone, I leave you alone\" which started in lethal protector where Venom actually upholds a deal not be a jackass and be a hero in the west coast if Spider-man leaves him alone. The villainous venom you're thinking of is similar to how Bob Kane originally wrote  batman, it was there it exist but isn't the character how he has been for 25  of the 30 years he's existed, that villainous \"WE HATE SPIDER-MAN SO MUCH\" venom is actually minority of the stories for him.  Read \"Edge of the Venomverse\" it specifically explores \"what if alternate versions of other heroes got the symboite\" witout it touching peter as far as the story says.\n",
      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\tShitty writers making a character behave wildly out of character in contradiction of decades of development means... what?   And yeah, Batman used to kill people in the 30’s. He also drove a red car and wore purple gloves in the 30’s too, and he doesn’t do those anymore either.  Why do you seem to think I give a crap if Venom is portrayed as a villain or not? All I’ve said is that his origin concerns Spider-Man in 616, which is the mainstream continuity and the one most commonly pulled from for pretty much every Marvel adaptation. There’s also Ultimate, but Venom in the movie is not even a little bit similar to Ultimate Venom, so that clearly isn’t the case, and Ultimate Venom is even more intimately connected to Peter than 616. Really, I don’t know how far along you got into your high school English classes, but if you look back at my old posts, you won’t find me saying anything about how Venom should be a villain.   And once again, I’ve read Venomverse. None of those other characters are Eddie Brock. The Venom Punisher is not Eddie Brock. The Venom Rider is not Eddie Brock. Captain Venom is not Eddie Brock. Old Man Venom is not Eddie Brock.  But you know who is Eddie Brock? The main fucking character of that story, 616 Venom, who has history with Peter Parker and whose origin as Venom, the hybrid of Eddie and the symbiote, concerns events involving Peter Parker.  Really, I don’t know how to make this any more clear. What other characters do with the symbiote is a non-sequitur and is completely irrelevant, because Eddie Brock is the topic of discussion, not those other characters.  Ideally, Venom’s origin story WOULD involve him being a villain, since I guess we’re moving on to this as the topic now, or at least hostile to Peter during their initial few encounters. Because that’s how his fucking origin story plays out. That’s another thing you seem to be missing, is my emphasizing of the phrase origin story, which this movie is supposed to be for the character.\n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t> behave wildly out of character in contradiction of decades of development means... what?   Shitty Writers? Jim Starlin (Batman's lead writer during the 80s and the writers of the KGBeast & car crushing story I mentioned) is a shitty writer? Late 1970s/80s Frank Miller is a shitty writer? Bill Finger(who wrote a majority of the early 40s stories) is a shitty writer?  If those are your ideas of shit writers, I don't trust your opinion on writing.  Development? what development? the idea of Bruce's no kill rule wasn't there and then suddenly was, in almost a just as drastic way as you're describing because if you read even 3 issues before Batman states the no kill rule for the very first time he's killing people left and right . There was no development of the no kill rule or even the no gun rule until the 90s when seduction of the gun came about. It just was something \"batman didn't do\"  > \"He also drove a red car and wore purple gloves ... and he doesn’t do those anymore either.\"  Except when he does: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hsPvP-tDf24/VFL9b_9XwEI/AAAAAAAAlfA/ChXuu0yctu8/s1600/Batman-Zero-Year-var-cov-paolorivera.jpg  I didn't say you gave a crap, I'm pointing out since that point in time, Venom's connection to Spider-man is the greatest/most intimate. Since he's walked away it's minimal at best and that's the part of venom they're focusing on, the part that doesn't think about Peter parker.  You read main venomverse, I'm talking about edge of venomverse.  In 616, this isn't 616, this is another Eddie, another Venom and just like how Ultimate made it more intimate of a connection, this makes it a non-connection to Peter Parker.  Ideally FOR YOU, for me I don't care about peter and I am more of a fan when the only mention of Peter regarding venom is, he exist in the same world. Yeah and it did it without Peter, because you don't need peter and this movie proved it.

They changed it, you don't like it, tough titty\n",
      "9. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJim Starlin is good, but I wouldn’t pin him as a good fit for Batman. Jim’s best work is with a more overtly villainous character, like Thanos. Jim Starlin’s Thanos is nigh perfect. Frank Miller, as far as Batman is concerned, is disgustingly overrated. I’m not even approaching that from the typical criticisms of his work being that he’s sexist or some kind of bigot or whatever, I just think that his incarnation of Batman is... fucking weird. TDKR made sense because Bruce was old and tired of people’s shit, so him being a bitter, excessivy violent dickhead fit (personally I think Paul Dini’s Batman Beyond’s version of old Bruce is better, but TDKR old Bruce is fine too). Then you have All-Star Batman and Robin where Batman is just a huge gaping asshole to everybody, including Robin himself, doing things like calling him retarded and just generally throwing insults at people.  Batman killing people in the 30’s/40’s lasted like 2 years before Bill Finger and Bob Kane rescinded it in Batman no. 4 (published in 1940). Batman in general, and comics in general, were nothing even remotely res resembling what they are today. Batman’s whole origin didn’t exist until, what, Detective Comics 33? 6 or 7 months after his actual debut. Batman’s first 2 and half years or so are so wildly different from the entire succeeding 8 decades that he may as well be someone entirely different. And Bill Finger and Bob Kane were the ones making the changes. They effectively rebooted Batman in 1940, and regardless of whatever the real world reason may have been, he didn’t kill people. Ever since, that’s been the definitive portrayal of Batman, and any time a writer has him overtly murder someone or even just not attempt to save someone from mortal danger, they’re writing him out of character as per Bill and Bob.\n",
      "10. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI disagree on Starlin, between Shang-Chi, Sliver Surfer, Dread star & Punisher, he's clearly on level but is more on board with the idea of Superheroes/heroic character that kill. Disagree on Miller, I believe he was an original batman fan who though \"this is the path Bruce would take\" regarding TDKR.  With all Star, I view it as \"This is a version of Bruce who is still mentally 8 years old who promised to spend his life warring on criminals and acting on it regardless of what others think.\" and partially what I always viewed Bruce Wayne generally as.   They rescinded it because of fainting couch PTA types, It wasn't because that's where they wanted to go, it's because their publishers had pressure put on them, same with Moulton and how he used S&M in wonder woman. Yeah, batman comics Today aren't even remotely resembling what they were 30 years ago even. Not sure why you're giving me time table on things, I know when these things were. Yeah and George lucas made the prequels, just because the creator does it doesn't mean they're above reproach for it or can't have their reasoning question. Except they didn't reboot it, if you read the issues he did kill when he was teamed up with Robin and the ones after they stated the no kill rule, the only thing he said is \"we don't kill\" now and instead of pushing someone back on to their ally's swords he tosses them aside, still the same writing style and tone. Cool if it's the definitive one, and people don't like them killing. I can choose not to care for it still and would prefer for the earlier one, pre bill and bob's **original intention**.\n",

      "Row 987, Column 'text' has multiple consecutive spaces: '1. Everyone points to Russia being the danger when it has an economy comparable to South Korea. Everything is directed at Russia when China is the one that is truly meddling with foreign affairs not just in the US and Canada but all over the world.  Russia is a boogeyman that the Left prop up. While I think Russia has problems, if you look into Russian geopolitics and their history it's fairly easy to understand where they're coming from and what their motivations are. For example NATO conducts military exercises in Latvia which is right on Russia's doorstep. The US has put defensive missiles in Romania and as Putin pointed out, 'what's the difference between a defensive missile and an offensive missile? It's just the programming.'  If Russia and the Warsaw pact was still a thing, imagine if they managed to slowly get Central American countries into the Warsaw pact. Then they start conducting military exercises in Mexico. That'd be quite alarming for people living in America and would put them on edge.  The Cold War ended in the early 90's and the USA has acted as if it never went away. Russians are merely trying to preserve their security which includes having buffer states. Russia likes having other countries either neutral or aligned to them between perceived threats.  A lot of people don't understand Russia or Russian history. I feel like if we took more time to learn more about this supposed boogeyman, we'd be closer to easing tensions with them.\n",
      "2. \tAnd that's why I'm here, asking the informed conservative shitposters what their thoughts are on the matter. I'm seriously open minded, I *want* to know why they're so bad.  I met a suspicious Russian before (won't go into detail), I just want to understand the motive and whether I should feel threatened about it.\n",
      "3. \t\tWhen the Cold War ended, Russia stopped flying bombers loaded with live nukes. The USA did not. The USA has expanded NATO into former Warsaw Pact nations to the point where NATO exists on Russia's doorstep. US/NATO strategy of containment is still being used where both Russia and China are essentially surrounded by military bases. Like I mentioned, drills are done in Latvia. Defense missiles are placed in Romania.  In the 90's Russia embraced America. They wore blue jeans started listening to our rock and roll. However the Kosovo War happened. Russia didn't use its UN Security Council veto on the grounds that NATO wouldn't use air power to bomb Belgrade. They did. The Russians saw this as a massive betrayal of trust and it's what allowed Putin to rise to power.  Russia was supportive of NATO going into Afghanistan. In fact one of Russia's few military bases is on the other side of the northern Afghan border. The supply lines for our troops there came from Russia, and the Russians used their military presence to prevent the Taliban from running north. However Russia opposed the Iraq Invasion, and used that invasion as an excuse to invade Georgia and Chechnya. \"If the US can do it, so can we.\" Was their reasoning.  In the Obama years when the US, France and etc. did their campaign in Libya, Russia was strictly opposed to a no fly zone so medical supplies and such could be aired in. Clinton said there would be no fly zone. Russia didn't veto the intervention in Libya. What happened? Again the USA lied.  Then you have what's going on in Syria. We have had many, many close calls in Syria between the USA and Russia. Dangerously so. You have the perfect conditions for a single fuck up to spiral into WW3. Remember all it took was one guy getting shot to spark WW1. I think the Russians and Americans operating in the area in Syria are likely in communication with each other for this exact reason, so they aren't stepping on each other's toes.  I believe that NATO has been particularly belligerent towards Russia. Russia has absolutely no reason to trust us, and I don't blame them when they take matters in their own hands in matters of their own security.\n",

Ice cream, Mandrake? Children's ice cream!...You know when fluoridation first began?...1946. 1946, Mandrake. How does that coincide with your post-war Commie conspiracy, huh? It's incredibly obvious, isn't it? A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual. Certainly without any choice. That's the way a hard-core Commie works.I first became aware of it, Mandrake, during the physical act of love...Yes, a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed.

Gaming was being dominated by the Super Nes and Sega Genesis for most of the 90’s and the best genres only those systems were absolutely not FPS. It was Platformers, Adventure games and RPGs.  Even when PSX and N64 dropped in the late 90’s those genres continued to dominate like a mother fucker. FPS got a huge kick in the ass with half life, counter strike, goldeneye and unreal tournament sure but, Pokémon, an RPG, literally dominated the sales charts for like 4 years from 97-2000.

      "2. \tFunny enough, someone asked him about those games - https://twitter.com/ckunzelman/status/1047225614611243010  And yeah, he doesn't think The Line is pessimistic but can't way what it is and that Dark Souls is just too hopeful.

      "4. \t\t\tArguing on that angle. I will say that in a sense the age of fire was unnaturally prolonged by people who desperately want the good times back only to fail and go insane from it. The final dlc for DS3 kind of hints that for the age of fire to truly happen the age of man is necessary  He did mention Will Oneil Games and looked up the studio that he is basing his narrative on and look at the description  >Little Red Lie >Little Red Lie is a contemporary adventure game about debt, family, and the truth about honesty.  >Actual Sunlight >Actual Sunlight is a short interactive story about love, depression and the corporation.  So to sum it up. The guy wants more \"Real life stories about mundane boring people in a pessimistic tone. But in a grounded setting\"  Yeah fuck no, the realism shit ate at my sense of sanity long ago. \n",
      "5. \t\t\t\tI, for one, will be forever suspicious of the so-called \"Age of Man\" when its proponents through the series form orders that are unabashedly built on greed, deceit, and murder, but I'll at least admit that the stories are purposefully made ambiguous as to let players come up with their own conclusions to what's going on and what factions, if any, are in the right.  But that's not to say that I believe Dark Souls is hopeless.  In fact, I'd say that there's something intrinsically hopeful about the series (and the titles) purely from the basic gameplay: players overcoming trials and hardships, vanquishing mighty foes encountered along the way.  As for the story, I'd point to the End of Fire ending of DS3, which I'd call the best closure to the series as a whole, being built on the Fire Keeper's hope that mercy-killing the artificially-prolonged world altogether will eventually give birth to a wholly new one.  It's just foolish to call Dark Souls hopeful by pointing to the Age of Dark, its nature being one of the series' most contentious story elements.  Bloodborne is a little more pessimistic in that none of the endings put a stop to the turmoil caused by warring Great Ones and their aspiring human servants, but at least the Yharnam Sunrise ending has you personally escaping from it.  > So to sum it up. The guy wants more \"Real life stories about mundane boring people in a pessimistic tone. But in a grounded setting\"  Yeah, that can be concluded from the games Cameron Kunzelman cites positively in the article.  I played Every Day the Same Dream many years ago (which takes like 10 minutes), and it's exactly as you describe.\n",

      "5. \t\t\t\tLol that was the best.   “They’re super technologically advanced, but they’re African. So they have to have super technologically advanced *spears.*”\n",
      "6. \t\t\t\t\tThat's called Afro-Futurism. There's a whole subsection of science fiction that takes high technological concepts and fits them into existing culture like a puzzle piece, rather than wiping the existing culture out for the clean neutral chrome lines of \"the future\" like was popular in the 1950s.   William Gibson is known for this- he practically predicted what is now the aesthetic reality of techno-Japan. He also wrote a book in 2014 called \"The Peripheral\" that is a love letter to the hillbilly Appalachia of the tech boom. Another good example is the gene-hack Thailand of The Wind-up Girl.   I think it makes sense because there's literally no reason an isolationist country would develop the same aesthetics as the country across the ocean. Why should Wakanda look like Stark Tower? They're two different groups of people. \n",
      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\tHe wrote Neuromancer, right?\n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, he did! \n",
      "9. \t\t\t\t\t\tBut this defeats the technically superior aspect. There is a reason spears went out of use that isn't related to fashion.\n",
      "10. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo, it doesnt, not if the spears are unshatterable and don't seem to follow the laws of physics.  Basically Wakanda has two issues- they're isolationist and they're advanced. That means their weaponry will look *vastly* different from what the world views as a powerful weapon, but perform just the same. They don't have guns at all (the be-all end-all of \"modern\" weaponry) because they've never made contact with China, so they don't have gunpowder and they've never heard of explosives. So they compensate with what they do have, which are throwable projectiles and a super-light super-strong alloy that can absorb energy and reflect it back.  In addition, Wakanda doesn't need to be warlike because they have the cloaking technology to hide, so their weapons tech isn't as advanced as some of their other types of tech.  I imagine if this story had taken place in a country in Europe that isolated themselves pre-Eastern contact we'd see a lot of crazy sword and shield technology instead. Come to think if it, doesn't Cap carry a shield? Isn't Thor a melee weapon user? And aren't those weapons also vastly superior to modern weaponry like Maria Hill's?\n",
      "11. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPretty sure their spears shot lasers, so they might as well be called guns at that point\n",
      "12. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYep those spears absolutely destroyed an armored car in one shot, they aren't being portrayed as spear chuckers when their spears have the long range ability of guns simply with different aesthetics \n",
      "13. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDoesn’t the chief of the warrior woman say “guns... how primitive” in BP\n",
      "14. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLmao, she's like Obi-Wan Kenobi. I can imagine she would probably think so since they need to be reloaded and they're fueled with basically rocks; and if Nakia has been doing work against Boko Haram that means they probably have shielding technology that stops bullets no issue. It really does seem to me like Wakanda skipped over inventing guns completely since they lacked that resource and see no use for them. \n",
      "15. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey’re also stunted tactically. The final battle in Black Panther would have been over much more quickly if the War Rhinos were used for a concentrated strike against T’Challa’s forces. A rapid breakthrough and encirclement like Blitzkrieg  EDIT: I would recommend Achtung! Panzer! for people interested in the theory of Blitzkrieg. English translations of it and Heinz Guderian’s memoirs are available\n",
      "16. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow do you reconcile ideas like \"advanced\" and \"no gunpowder, no explosives\" ? I don't mean the literal gunpowder, anything that may store ready to use energy may do.  Surely, their physics is similar to our own enough that they realise faster delivery of a pointed, sharp projectile by infusing kinetic energy inside it via some mechanism damages more in less time without compromising on precision? Because we know there is kinetic energy in their physics that works just like ours.   Also that part is objectively wrong, the movie begins with him launching three frisbees that explode.\n",
      "17. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy should I have to reconcile \"advanced\" with \"no explosives\"? There's more than one way to be advanced, lol. Thinking that you cant be technologically advanced without guns is really silly...even Star Wars showed that you dont even need to invent the *wheel* to be advanced enough that your civilization is spacefaring. Not every society will develop their tech in the same line as the US has and where they might \"lack\" in one area, like gunpowder, they make up in other areas, like advanced shielding or laser projectiles (I'm assuming the exploding Frisbee weren't gunpowder fueled, because nearly everything in Wakanda is Vibranium fueled).    The reason Cultural Futurism exists is because it's an interesting thought experiment in weaving a culture with a technology in ways that make sense to that culture. It's kind of like playing Civ V...maybe you don't have guns because you branched out in research to boost your Science instead, skipped Gunpowder and discovered Uranium and Flight. In that example, I wouldn't call anyone with a space shuttle \"not advanced\", even if the weapons tech seems stuck in the classical age. \n",

You will NEVER please these people. And they don't buy your games anyway.\n",
      "2. \tBeing able to pick your gender can be perfectly fine if it suits the story and the setting. If you're supposed to be a knight in medieval Europe saving the country, the king or whatever, being a woman really breaks the immersion. She wouldn't be a knight and she likely wouldn't even be able to move in the kind of armor they wore. It's just how things were back then. The same goes for a game where you're storming the Normandy beaches for example, you should not be able to pick your gender in such a game, it'd be completely ridiculous seeing women rushing across Omaha beach or whatever.  If it's a setting where it makes no difference I'm obviously fine with it. I've played plenty of games where you couldn't even pick your gender but where you were simply forced to play as a female if you wanted to be a certain class. I played a lot of Diablo II for example, and if you wanted to play as a sorceress you were going to be playing a female character, period. There was no choice for a male sorcerer at all. The amazon was also female only.   It's not like men didn't play the sorceress or the amazon. The sorceress was *the* way to kill bosses fast if you wanted to \"MF\" (Magic Find - killing bosses for good loot) so it's probably the most popular class in the entire game even though it's only available as a female character. No one cares when it isn't immersion or lore breaking.\n",
      "3. \t\tHistorical fiction is a thing.Sure,actual women didn't do that but if the developer makes it clear that they aren't following history,well they don't have to.And you have the choice to not buy the game.  This becomes even more clear in settings based on history.Take medieval fantasy.They are based on the middle ages but since it's the writers world,they can do anything with the lore.Obviously they cant add flying cars or shit, but if they want to write a famous all-female kings guard,they can.\n",
      "4. \t\t\tSure, that's sort of what I meant with the Diablo II example, in that world apparently only women throw around ice spells and stuff, and that's perfectly fine.  What I can't stand is people making a WWII game or whatever and then having women all over the place, or suspiciously high amount of diversity etc. It's so obvious that they're doing it for political reasons and nothing else, they're shoving their own politics down the throats of everyone playing the game, and there's no \"warning\" about it.  I mean, these days we have people whining about a lack of black people in The Witcher etc. It's Poland in the Middle Ages, you'd be lucky to see a single black person in your life, it'd be like spotting a unicorn in the wild.  Obviously people are free to make an all female war game if they want to, and if they want their game to fail, but then they shouldn't market it as a WWII shooter or whatever. That's just dishonest marketing. The idea that you can just add \"Based on a true story.\" and then make shit up annoys me to no end. If the only thing that's remotely close to reality is that it takes place in Normandy, it's not close enough for \"Based on a true story.\" to be acceptable imo, it should mean something.\n",

But then again, in most of these cases, it's an attractive, white or Hispanic pervery, cunt who was married or didn't have a man. The ones that didn't, would've turned men down online and on dating apps any day. Yet they would've crawl up in bed with an underage boy any chance they got.  Even attractive white or hispanic lesbos, have victimized girls when most certainly they could have easily connected to another pervery attractive woman online or on dating apps, or at bars. They could get the type of women that many men cannot get. As women and as lesbians or bisexual women they would easily find a partner that they would have the hots for .   Such as Brooke Rosendale who raped/molested a 12 year old girl, Jaclyn Truman as a \"devout Christian\" who victimized a 15 year old girl, Allison Leigh Chilton who molested and sexted one of her special ed students who was a 12 year old girl, Hilary Dittalo, Sarah Barton whose victim's age hadn't come up.

Feminists are a classic example of men not necessarily giving into instinct when it comes to women. They know the amount of trouble they'll get into if they even have a one night stand.  We hear the stories constantly from feminists especially who bitch about being unable to find a man or how unsatisfied they are with the sex they're getting. Even with married women, I still maintain they're predatory and are just looking for easy dick. Think about it, it's much easier to seduce a teenage boy who doesn't know any better thinking they're going to get tons of sex than waste time trying to convince a paranoid guy in his 20's they're not crazy that's either been through crazy girlfriends before or has seen women that age do to their partners.  The fact that they know the likelihood of them getting any real kind of punishment for what they're doing is probably encouraging them to act the way they do.\n",

More than that, if you're citing a group of career advisors who likely have no experience with gaming but watch TV and movies like it's a religion, no wonder they aren't advising that you go into games. It may even be coming from a place of love, they see TV and movie people making millions, but couldn't even name a development studio, let alone specific dev.  Then, of course, the gamedrop: >\"A lot of the challenges come from the online space. When things like Gamergate bleed into the mainstream consciousness, it's not going to do much to reinform the public or aspiring developers about what the industry is like,\" she says. \"And that's a shame because I really have met so many creative and progressive individuals and organisations from my short time in the games industry.\"  Her direct quote is interesting, a generous interpretation may hold that she regrets what the media made of GG, because she's met supportive and nice people on the inside. Her later quotes argue for greater representation, but do so in a relatively sane way, so it could be.  The article goes into her game a bit. It is evidently ten minutes long, but is a homage/reference to the games Ico and Inside, the film Paths of Glory, and the German TV show Generation of War? How do you manage that many references/influences in a ten minute game?  Some literal objectification: >The unconscious character is central to a concept Fernandez was interested in: creating an emotional attachment between the player and the 'tool' used to solve puzzles (in this case, a human body).  She shows some remarkable sanity regarding how she thinks greater representation should be achieved: >\"One thing that I really want to stress is that I don't think the solution is to police or censor violent or sexual depictions of women in games. To me, it's about creating a bigger variety of female representations instead of just repeatedly falling back on character tropes. It's in everyone's best interest. We'll have far more interesting games as a result.  Again, a generous interpretation would be that she wants to make her own games with new female characters, our brothers-in-arms over at r/WerthamInAction will appreciate that approach I think.  Then some light-to-middling misrepresentation of the facts regarding the Battlefield V fiasco, and this gem: >\"It's intimidating,\" she admits, \"but it's more important to me to make stories I'm interested in with characters I'm interested in, rather than fear this imaginary audience who will probably troll me online at some point in my career anyway.  The author of the article is kinda bad, but the dev depicted seems to have her head/PR game on straight.  \n",

      "Row 1119, Column 'text' has multiple consecutive spaces: '1. Someone debunked this guy - and it was Cecilia? What timeline is this?  > Picciolini, who describes himself as a “former white supremacist leader,” came onto Kotaku’s radar in July, when he hosted a Reddit AMA. In it, he claimed that right-wing extremists go into multiplayer games to recruit vulnerable demographics into their cause. Intrigued, my colleague Kashmir Hill and I reached out to Picciolini to hear more. We were curious about the right-wing movers and shakers who could fit an entire political pitch into a Fortnite match.  > When we asked Picciolini for evidence of his claim and an interview, he referred us to “the many who have experienced the recruitment” and attached a few screenshots of Nazi imagery in open world games like All Points Bulletin. He also forwarded a screenshot of the game Active Shooter, a school shooting simulator, which was pulled from Steam before its release. Another screenshot was from a YouTube video titled “Fag Jews” in which someone named AuTiSmGaMiNg played Call of Duty. It had 11 views.  > It’s hard to imagine that the blustering Picciolini has seen enough to make up for the NPR author’s otherwise sparse evidence, and if you have spent any time in an online multiplayer game, you know that some player-made digital swastika is as likely a product of some 12-year-old edgelords as it is of neo-Nazi propagandists seeking to turn the teens to their side. This leads to basic questions: Were any victims of the alleged conversion tactics interviewed? Any recruiters? If this is happening on a large scale, why haven’t any games journalists—and especially ones who spend countless hours each week playing online games—caught a whiff of this wild thing and reported on it?  > NPR’s sources, at least as laid out in their report, simply do not provide adequate support for the claim that white supremacists are actively recruiting gamers on multiplayer games on a scale broad enough for anyone to be concerned about it. And to take it a step further, mainstream media publications claiming a clear pipeline between gamers and far-right extremists are buckling into a trope in normie games coverage that simply needs to end if anyone is going to responsibly cover the increasingly established gaming community: parental fear-mongering as journalism. It’s what turned the mainstream conversation around video game addiction into a hot-take circus of bad research and even worse interviewing tactics. It’s what’s completely distorted the scientific methods toward understanding whether violent games make kids more violent. And it’s the sort of thing that, in the ‘80s, led suburban parents to question whether their Dungeons & Dragons-playing teens were literal Satanists.  > The NPR story’s author, who is a mother of two, wrote a book this year titled The Art of Screen Time: How Your Family Can Balance Digital Media and Real Life. Reached out to for comment, she did not respond. When I asked Picciolini why he feels confident stating that there is a pipeline between gamers and far-right extremists, he said this:  >> “I receive emails or calls weekly from parents concerned that their young sons are beginning to use language aligned with alt-right and white nationalist ideologies, narratives denying the Holocaust or defaming Jews, discussing conspiracy theories related to George Soros. Parents tell me time and time again that they believe that they are being influenced while playing multiplayer video games by other people participating in those games. It begins by using language like “f*ggot” and “n*gger” to desensitize them, followed by memes, then young people beging [sic] to parrot the words until they are led to forums on gaming sites or 4chan and 8chan.”  Bets on her getting screaming SJWs in her mentions today?\n",

      "2. \tYep, literally every other system in the game is severely underdeveloped. Fun ends right as you realise that there are no significant unlockables, no loot, very basic exploraton of an empty eye candy, and barely any variety or plot. Only the first location of the game isnt empty or boring, and filled with variety.   Release state of the game was mechanically the same as early access version from almost 3 years prior (FrankieOnPc did a video on the game at that time, and it looked great, getting regular content patches with new stuff), with 2 added endgame underwater locations and 1 new vehicle. I wonder how long into development they fired their gamedesigners and had to work with what they had. I think it was somewhere near the Aurora exploration patch, because the ship literally has placeholder textures inside, and consists of 4 rooms with drinkable water and empty bags. They even cut the most fun gadget, terraformer, from end release.  And after the release, the game got exactly 1 patch, almost 2 months after, despite many critical and still unfixed bugs (you can literally fall through the map at any point).  But for some crazy reason this shitshow has an overwhelmingly positive rating on steam, ffs.  Edit: just found out they are making a \"stand alone expansion\" to the game, to release this winter. I wonder how they will fuckup this time.\n",
      "3. \t\tHoly hyperbole. I don't know what games you've been playing, but calling Subnautica's exploration \"basic\"? Or saying that is has barely any plot? What game does have a plot then?  >the ship literally has placeholder textures inside, and consists of 4 rooms with drinkable water and empty bags.  I mean, this is literally not true. Being upset with the developer is one thing, but let's not go overboard.\n",
      "4. \t\t\tI don't see how what's he's saying is a \"holy\" hyperbole.  This game has only two strengths - an interesting map to explore and an audio design that makes me nearly orgasmic every time I even think about it.  Everything else is mediocre at best.  Game is choke full of artificial obstacles and handicaps - classic for survival games hunger, thirst and dumb monsters annoying you on every step and some specific for this game like oxygen, depth, lack of reliable way to kill monsters, stupidly slow movement that is slow no matter what, random pieces of equipment you need to scan, backpack that is tiny for absolutely no reason and etc.  Seriously, after just an hour I said \"fuck it\" and turned off hunger and thirst because crawling back and forth again and again between your base and whatever place, because you can carry very limited amount of stuff at once, while constantly surfacing every 30 seconds was annoying enough even without carrying about growing plants and finding water.  And few days later I checked out if there is any mods and oh muh god there are mods, specifically there are mods that tries to fix all the basic problem of this game balance - adjusts movement speeds of fins and vehicles, makes inventory size normal and etc. And the expected reply to this is \"duh, it just makes game easier, casul\". And you know what? No, it's fucking not, it makes game playable. Everything that it changes is the awful gameplay loop of \"crawl back and fort 40 times to get enough crap to build this crap\" to \"swim  back and forth 4 times to get enough crap to build this crap\". That's it. It made this game kinda fun because now it's much less irritating. And faster sub is much more fun to use.  Now speaking about exploration - what's not \"basic\" about it? You just randomly wander around trying to find stuff you need. There is nothing that makes is much different from any other survival game - the only differences of Subnautica's exploration from Minecraft is that in latter you need to mine to get deeper and its' world is random. You just aimlessly wander around collecting stuff and crafting things until another story event starts, then you go to another drop prod, loot it, get some blueprint and go back to wandering and collecting stuff until another event or until you randomly hit some alien temple or whatever. Thinking back to my playthrough - I seriously have no idea how I made it to the end, how I found the temples, the keys, the fish, the deeper caves and etc. It just happened, like it happens when you find stronghold in minecraft. There is nothing special about Subnautica in this regard, if anything, its' world is actually tiny, pretty empty, has just a few different zones and not a lot of things to find and to do. And I really don't see how  >the ship literally has placeholder textures inside, and consists of 4 rooms with drinkable water and empty bags.  is not true. There are just a few different rooms that are pretty much copy-pasted and filled with different props. There are just a few objects to interact with on the ship and only a few things to do. And this is applicable to the whole world - it's just a medium-sized sandbox colored into different colours and filled with different props.  Of all the places in Subnautica, right now, after ~half a year, I can remember only few ares - ship and your starting crash zone, red area nearby, caves with a tree, caves with giant skeleton, caves with lava and two boring islands...oh, and a cube. I can't remember anything else because there is just nothing memorable in this game. Or because those are all the places in the game, which is not much better.  And there is nothing else to do either - you can just collect crap and build crap, like in any normal survival game and try to progress by the story, which is short if you aren't handicaped by the normal game balance. In minecraft, for example, besides those same things I can at least try to build an epic base, full of redstone mechanisms or explode a nearby mountain with TNT. In Subnautica you can...ugh...try to kill giant fish in lava caves with mining mech? (I did it 2 times. Both times it wasn't fun and it was just retarded and meaningless. Also I just remembered that devs said that game has no guns because \"muh violence\" - how drilling something to death is less violent than just shooting it? Idk) Because you can't even build a cool base - building system is restricted by modules and it's extremely dumb, I can't remember what were my problems exactly but I know I had a lot of them while trying to build my cool base. And even more problems while I was trying to build bases in some weird places, like alien temple thing, where you can park a sub.   And everything else is this game is just...\"ugh\" as well.   The only fun thing I can remember is the big submarine. It's actually an ass to control and it's an absolute ass to use generally, without mods, but I had mods and I loved it. But only because I had mods.  So, yeah, I don't know if it's obvious enough from my dumb random critique, but this game is an ass that is mainly saved by its' atmosphere (and partially by it's story that is also ends being an ass) which is mainly kept together by gorgeous sound design, pretty graphics and a few interesting places. I hate this game but I think I will be coming back to ride a submarine again and again just because of how this game sounds and how fun the submarine is.  *Fixing all the typos and grammatical errors I can find cause it's 2am and I'm a russian bot that can't into proper english.\n",
      "5. \t\t\t\tPeople really love this game here for some reason, and are choosing to ignore that its an underdeveloped mess. I had several friends complete it, all were pumped and happy for the first few days, and very dissapointed after finishing it, all had exactly the same feeling that the gameplay content basically ended half way through the story. \n",
      "6. \t\t\t\t\tI just checked out the patch notes history for this game and realised that it's already finished. It's done. By the developers standards there is enough content to call it a finished game. This is just sad. And I also noticed no fixes or changes to the building system...oh my.  I feel like this game is one of the cases of \"great concept in the wrong hands\".\n",

I've honestly come to appreciate a very few subs here on reddit, as being places where the mods actually get the basic concept of freedom, that they don't need to nanny the conversations of a bunch of free adults as if we were toddlers about to put scissors into each other's eyes.  I was pointed at r\\metacanada a long time ago by a friend, who thought it was merely a shit-posting bullshit Canadian version of the donald, but I quickly found it's one of the few places left you can actually have a free and honest discussion.  The Jordan Peterson subs are another great crowd, with enough great folks to far outweigh the inevitable idiots, and the mods are very genuinely tolerant there too.  I would actually go so far as to say that reddit has been the very most worthwhile forum site I've participated in so far over decades of internet time.  It's not perfect, and many subs are either not as free as they should be or even ruined, but there is still huge opportunity here to have extremely good discussions with people, and the overall format is capable of supporting in depth content in a way that sites like facespam and twatter can't begin to touch.  So I say take control, and only make good things of real substance here, reap the rewards of what is worthwhile, and leave behind the trivial and the BS.  Fuck r\\canacuck, you don't need to deal with idiots and assholes who can't handle even the most noncontroversial factual reality.  The free and sane places will be rambunctious and irreverent, sometimes in the extreme, but that's good, it's alive for real, instead of mind-controlled-numb by the thought police.  Cheers :)\n",

It isn't. She did make comments that are questionable but each and every single person quoting this conversation doesn't take into account the larger context of that stream. We have a singular statement that, while making fun of the marriage, doesn't implicitly say that she married the guy on purpose. While the rabid mob will not see that the same way, it is important to keep in mind the context of the quote in order to make it admissible in court.  But what every single person here seems to forget is that in order to be divorced, they need to justify their reasoning (including her situation that she is from another country) for filing divorce in Canada. So unless you believe that the Canadian system is so shit that she slipped through, she has been going through that in a legal manner and not get deported for it.   >> Additionally, the problem is that it's not an accusation alone.

It's not about what she said, it's about how you choose to **forego** legal procedure in favour of vigilante justice through societal slandering and accusations.

People don't want this product, and it's being sold to them as if it's something other than a shallow cash grab. It doesn't matter if a proper Diablo game is still being developed; the problem is that they thought so little of their audience that they thought we'd love this. That's a problem.

If the CPC had managed to form a minority govt. or reduced the LPC to a minority he would be in a much better position to leverage his influence and get some tangible results.  2. If the CPC failed miserably he could easily stage a coup and take the reins of the CPC likely setting the party up for a victory in 2023.

Use the officer training that you were supposed to have received and de-escalate the situation by cuffing her— not beating her to a pulp. But whatever. Fine. If a cop ever uses excessive force on you or a loved you, you have no right to get mad about it because, according to you and the dutch, they can NEVER be wrong— if they are wrong, the other person is even MORE wrong, therefore, apparently, the cop is right. According to you, and the dutch, two wrongs somehow make a right.   It was excessive force. The lady needed to be punished, but not like that. There are 6 cops right there. Try to explain to me how 6 cops can’t apprehend one drunk woman. If they can’t they need better training.   Let me ask you: whats the point of the judicial system, according to you? Honestly?

If this was a man you wouldn't cry misandry, the misogyny doesn't make sense. A person is a person. They obviously tried to cuff her and she resisted. This is the next step. Police aren't going to take risks infront of a crowd with agressive people trying to hurt them, male or female. Killings by cop aren't common at all in Holland, like i said this is not the USA. It very rarely happens, not even one this year. The 6 cops were there for crowd control, as you can clearly see in the video. This is standard procedure. As little as possible arrest while the others make sure the crowd disperses. Cops won't use excessive force on me or a loved one as, like i said, cops are the most respected and trusted authority in the country. They score higher than other people and even neighbours. Things like this are very rare and excessive force therefore even more. She could walk and stand fine, there was no excessive force here, just the most efficient way to handle the situation. Even if the arrest wasn't correct, she abused the cop. The arrest can be wrong all you want, we both don't know, but because she abused the cop this was completely legal and no one will even look into it guarenteed. You respect cops here, even if they're wrong. If you're wrongfully arrested and you behave well you will most likely go free, there's a reason our prisoners per capita is one of the lowest in the world. Our judicial system is great. This is not the USA.  Here's an article about our prisons closing because we have too little prisoners. People here don't have to fear cops or the judicial system so things like this are rare and severely judged by the public. You don't attack cops.   https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dutch-prisons-are-closing-because-the-country-is-so-safe-a7765521.html%3famp\n",
      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\tWhere in the video did the police try to cuff her? Is it before they pushed her? Or after the cop punched her in the face four times? Cause I didn’t see it. Who else in the crowd was trying to hurt the police? Who, exactly, and speak loudly so the court room can hear you, was being aggressive towards the police other than the woman? If they were there for crowd control, why, at the beginning of the video, were they all crowded into one corner? Thats bad crowd control tactics if you ask me. If this stuff rarely happens in Holland, why is the cop so afraid that this lady posses a massive, lethal threat? Punching people 4 times in the face, throwing them on the ground, kicking them while they are down is standard proceedure? Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? What the hell kind of country are you from? Punching someone multiple times, throwing them on the ground, kicking them, waving a baton around THEN arresting is THE most efficient way to handle her? Instead of, ya know, just tackling her and cuffing her?   The lady is absolutely in the wrong!!! I am not debating that! I am debating the cops use of excessive force— irregardless of the lady doing what she did. Cops are supposed to be better than the people they are arresting— according to you they don’t have to be because “it rarely happens here.” What happens when it DOES happen there? Do you all just  shrug your shoulders and proclaim “well the police are ALWAYS right?” I get it, you love the police more than your mother, but it still doesn’t make it right. You say the police will “never” use excessive force on you or a loved one... what happens if they do? Seriously, what do you do then? What if you or a loved one ends up dead because of it? You just  shrug your shoulders cause the police are always right, right?   Basically, all you have told me is that you are pro-police brutality “because it rarely happens here” and you are completely fine with ONE man being a judge, jury, and executioner. You are also fine with stripping away the human right to a fair and equal trial. That sounds like fascism to me. Is that really the side you’re trying to pull here? \n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou really like putting words in my mouth haha, fascism, saying i would defend cops killing for no reason, saying i think cops are always right. It's clear that you're more of an emotional than a rational person, that's alright, but can you maybe base a single argument on something i actually said instead of just assuming everything? I never said any of that. You're assuming the cop thinks she's a lethal threat. Again, i'm sorry, but that's another dumb assumption. What is it with you and over the top assumptions? She is a threat, no one said anything about lethal. Ironic how easily you assume things about what i think but you can't assume the cops handled the situation in a proper fashion before the video began. You really have no idea what you're talking about, you're only defending her because she's such a fragile woman. Get over yourself, she abused a cop, this is justified by law and by public opinion. Crowd control is not something done only when crowds get aggressive, it's always done in case crowds get aggressive. It's called preventing a dangerous situation and it shouldn't be that hard to fathom. She was already under arrest, don't you understand that? She RESISTED ARREST. The didn't punch her first, arrested her after. They arrested her, she didn't comply with the arrest so they had to take physical actions. If you don't even know what an arrest is it's hard to talk reason with you. Arrest is verbal. When an officer says you're under arrest, you are arrested. She bothers the cops, is pushed away, she hits the cop, he defends, then she's arrested and then she hits the cop again, resisting arrest. You are one to talk about police violence, look at your own numbers and then look at ours, it's clear to see that lethal force is astronomically less common here than in the USA. Punching someone who punches cops is standard procedure everywhere. Tackling is way more dangerous, cop will be on the floor in a vulnerable position. But you don't understand anything about how police do their job so it's logical your emotions get the best of you. The cops are better than the people they arrested. Those people were being aggressive in bars, the handcuffed the first person without problems, then made sure the woman wasn't a threat anymore either. This woman, like you said, was in the wrong, and the cops were better. Cops should be better, and here they clearly were? The didn't attack anyone unprovoked (woman did) they only retaliated (woman instigated multiple times) and they remained professional and controlled the situation. Your entire argument is based on me saying police are always right, funny thing is i never once said that. You are an emotional person and paint the worst picture of the cops, and me, in your head with all your assumptions. Your argument is based on zero facts. Non-lethal measures against aggressive people resisting arrest within reason is never excessive force. It's amazing how you bend the facts so extremely. Everything you say \"i have told you\" i literally did not say and do not believe. You are arguing against an enemy you made up in your own head. Saying that police can't act until there's been a trial is ridiculous and you know that, don't play dumb. Cops have to act in an instance to take out a threat to ensure the safety of themselves and others, they did the right thing and you can't accept that because she's only a fragile woman (who ATTACKED COPS MULTIPLE TIMES)\n",
      "9. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGod you’re a fucking pussy if you think this lady posed a threat to six, trained officers. If she isn’t a lethal threat, why does the cop need to repeatedly beat her in her face? YOU don’t KNOW how much damage that can do! She could be retarded for the rest of her life because she made a stupid decision WHILE drunk. Don’t EVER make any stupid decisions while you’re inebriated otherwise you are a hypocrite.   Now, I didn’t put words in your mouth, I asked you questions. Feel free to try to actually answer them next time before trying to read me like a book and make assumptions about me (ironic, huh?)   You’re ONLY thinking about the safety of the cops here while also saying that violence against cops almost never happen there. Jesus christ, have some humanity dude. This lady posed literally no threat to 6 trained officers— oh boohoo the cop got a bruise on his arm. This lady could be a vegetable for the rest of her life after the blows that cop delivered to her face and you’re totally fine with it— you even support it.    Now, if this was a link to an article saying “woman sentenced to ‘x’ years for assaulting officers” I would be right there with you— it isn’t. Instead, its a cop using an excessive amount of force to apprehend one, singular drunk lady while 5 of his counterparts stand within striking distance of both of them. And you’re all cheerin it on. You all just watched a women get the snot beat out of her because she took some drunken swats at an officer. If this lady posed a legitimate threat, then I would also be with you— she clearly doesn’t. She gets tossed around like a rag doll all throughout the video. You guys keep talking about the “potential” threat she posed, how about we talk about the ACTUAL threat she posed which, according to the vide evidence, was slim to none. The officer got a few scratches. Boo fuckin’ hoo. Here’s a band-aid.   It may be legal, but that doesn’t mean its right. The lady engaged in the violence, and the cop was sure to retaliate with thrice the amount of pain and ten times the amount of possible destruction that he could have caused on her and her life.   Let me ask you the same question I asked another guy, and please actually respond to this one: what do you do if you see an officer beating your wife/daughter/mother. You don’t know why the officer is there, he just is and, boy, is he rocking your loved one. Do you just stand by and shrug your shoulders? What if he kills your mother/girlfriend/aunt because of too much trauma to her brain? What then? Is he officer still in the right? \n",
      "10. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYOU don't KNOW how much damage a drunk, I'd say already retarded without getting hit, woman can do. Would you say the same thing about someone why killed someone while driving drunk? Or raped someone while intoxicated? No you wouldn't because you only care about this because she's a woman. If a girl gets \"raped\" while both parties are drunk surely you'd take the girls side and say it doesn't matter that he was drunk! Same when there's a drunk driver. Being drunk is no excuse. If one of my family members would be treated like that i would be extremely fucking mad yes. At them. For being such a fucking idiot to ATTACK a cop like that MULTIPLE TIMES. I would say they fucking got what they deserved for harrasing and abusing cops, i guess victin morality is too much ingrained in you and you project it onto all women. She is not a victin she is an abuser. \n",
      "11. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow you’re putting words in my mouth in saying that I would always side with the drunk woman: I ALREADY SAID THE WOMAN IS IN THE WRONG AND DESERVES THE RIGHTFUL CHARGE ONE WOULD GET WHEN ASSAULTING AN OFFICER. Get that through your thick, dutch skull.  I already told you there is no context, you don’t know why the officer is beating your loved one, he just is. You don’t know if your wife/mother/aunt hit the officer. You simply walk in the room and see an officer beating the pulp out of them. But, I guess you’re totally fine with your own mother getting beat by an officer. You love your police MORE than you love your own mother. Thats sad. I feel bad for any close women in your life, considering you are not only totally fine with them getting beat— you’re totally fine with them getting beat *for no reason.* you’ll sit there and assume that the beating that they are getting is rightfully deserved, you’ll blame your own family member, dis-regard the situation and— irregardless of whether you know why they are getting beat or not. Thats fucking sad.   This woman is not a victim, but she does not deserve to get her face beat in by a cop. she deserves a jail sentence and she deserves to serve time. The fact that you think that all women deserve to get beat for throwing half-assed, drunken swats at someone is absolutely disgusting. I feel bad for the women in your life. You must treat them like shit. I do know how much damage a drunk girl can do because I DEALT WITH IT ALL THROUGHOUT COLLEGE. They don’t hurt. I can assure you of that. \n",
      "12. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou're one to talk about putting words in a mouth. God damn you must be stupid. You've been doing that in every comment and i literally said i GUESS you'd do that. Come on troll\n",
      "13. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRight, so now that I’ve beaten you in an argument and made you look stupid now Im a troll. Go figure.   Still, its sad that you love the police more than your own mother. \n",
      "14. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere you go again putting words into my mouth. Do you see now why i didn't respond fully? You are not to be reasoned with, like i said you've made me an imaginary enemy so you can play the victim card. Plus it's late in Holland and I'm going to bed, but i don't assume you know how timezones work because your entire view of the world seems America focused. Beaten me in the argument haha you are making up imaginary improbable situations to strawman me while i just state facts. Don't make me fucking laugh. The way you constructed an entire situation about me walking in to a room where police are abusing my family without context (not at all relevant to the discussion because that's clearly not what happened in the video, there was plenty of context, she was kicked out and harassing bar personnel) is so ridiculous i thought you must be trolling. \n",
      "15. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLol, I asked that question to get a handle of your character because it sheds a lot of light on your argument.   This situation is about a woman breaking the law and receiving an unnecessary beating because of it.  I asked you, if you saw your loved one being beat with no context, what would you think?   Your words, roughly:  “I would be mad. At them. (Your loved one) for being an idiot and assaulting an officer”  This, in turn, tells me that, no matter the situation, the cop is right. You don’t know if your loved one did something wrong, or something right.   Yet, some how, some way, the beating that they are receiving is *still* warranted. That was YOUR answer. Maybe think next time before you shoot yourself in the foot with your own answers. If you’re worried that I’m going to create some grand fantasy (which I didn’t, Everything above is my actual logic that was drawn from *your* answers) answer the question smarter. OR defer the question and don’t answer it at all!   How is that relevant to this video? It tells me that you think the police actually can do no wrong. That, under no circumstances, could an officer handle a situation better. That, no matter what this lady, or your loved one did, no matter how significant or insignificant the offense— if any offense— the beating that they are receiving is absolutely necessary in making sure that lawful justice is served.    That is disgusting. Good night. \n",
      "16. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt doesn't matter whether the cop is right or not. How. Can. You. Be. So. Dense. Even if the cop is wrong, you do what they say. Even if they're wrong, you don't abuse them. You're deduction that i must think the cop is always right because i would be mad at my family for disrespecting and abusing an officer is so far fetched i don't even want to read the rest of the comment. Something is wrong with your perception of logic. Yes i don't know if they did anything wrong or not, this is not related to my reaction to them abusing an officer though. You say \"it tells me\" so fucking often, in every comment you assume what i think, every single time wrongly. I keep repeating that you're making an enemy in your heard and play the victim, but it doesn't get through to you. And then you have the audacity to tell me I'm putting words in YOUR mouth, get a grip come on. It doesn't matter what the fuck you've done, it can be fucking nothing. If you don't attack the Dutch police they won't attack you, it's that easy. Of course the beating is warrented if they ATTACKED THE COP FIRST. Which this entire thing is about. If there is absolute no context fuck yeah I'm picking the cops side, they are highly respected members of society like i mentioned fucking hours ago. Of course they can be wrong, but that doesn't mean I'm not assuming they're not with good reason. Funny how you try to get out of a losing argument by saying i should pretend there's no context and make it about the completely irrelevant statement \"cops are always right\" , as this is about a video where there is clear context and the cop is clearly in the right. But to answer that specific question of yours: if i walk in a room, no context, and i see my family member assault an officer with no context what so ever, just like the video, and the cop retaliates, i am 100 percent picking the side of the law. I've been stating this over and over again and the fact that you think i shoot myself in the foot by saying this and claim the cop is always right (which additionally is completely irrelevant to the argument anyway) there's something wrong with your comprehension. \"doesn't matter how. Insignificant the offense\" the offense is assaulting an officer of the law you dense idiot, that's what it's been about the entire time. Truly you must be a troll, got me though, good job. \n",
      "17. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIm  just hung up on the beating being warranted in any way, shape or form. It doesn’t de-escalate the situation at all. Its essentially senseless considering the means with which the police have to apprehend people. And, if its not senseless then its inefficient. The cop could tackle the lady, the other cops would swarm her, over power her, and have her in a squad car before the video is even over.   But fine. Maybe its a cultural disconnect, like you said. You always side with police no matter what, and I always side with not beating people for not much of a reason other than to hit back for the sake of hitting back. Just because someone hits you, it doesn’t mean you hit them back. Is it within the cops right? Absolutely. Again, that doesn’t mean he should do it. Look at the size of the cop compared to her. She is treated like a rag-doll when he handled her. Instead of doing all of that, making a huge fuss, causing people to run, the cop could have capped it and ended it there by tackling her to the ground, and cuffing her.   And look, the woman is completely at fault. She deserves her punishment in a court— or however you do it in holland. She deserves her time, and that, I believe, is justice. The root of that fuss is obviously coming from her, she is the biggest factor in the fuss. The thing is, the cops contribute to the fuss. If it was up to me, that would not be an officer’s purpose. You try your best not to contribute violence in a situation when you don’t need to and the officer really did need to at all. If you think he did, I still need you to rationally explain how a drunk lady can do more than a black eye on a cop. If she had a weapon, you would think she would have drawn it after a punch or two. But she didn’t, so maybe at that point you stop punching her and just cuff her. Then again, maybe not. You guys handle your women however you want, I guess. I won’t tell you what to, and what not to do with them.   The base of my argument is that I just believe the police can, and should do better than that. They shouldn’t have to beat people in order to get them to comply. Its not their job to injure criminals, its their job to apprehend them.  The only times I feel it IS warranted is life or death situations, riots, or a raid. But, presumably you raid with guns, so I don’t know why there would be a beating involved. But I digress.   Finally, I guess I’ll apologize. I get a little emotional when I get in a “political” debate. Maybe it really is just cause we’re from different parts of the world. \n",

Regarding the two points you actually made about *my* comment:   See, your first example is what I mean when I want to differentiate between mindless posting of (for example) racists phrases in contrast to being racist in some kind of comedic context. Another example could be the infamous nazi pug video. Yes, the pug did a nazi salute, but it was obviously supposed to be a joke.  And about steam being a private company: Well you didn't really bring an argument for that one, just a snarky remark. Still, steam obviously wants to cater to the largest audience of people who play or purchase videogames (among other things). Allowing users to write whatever they want in whatever context they want is rarely a good concept. I know you'll see that as censorship, but from a solely financial standpoint they're better off moderating their website to a certain extend to ensure that the majority of their users are happy.

      "Row 1185, Column 'text' has multiple consecutive spaces: '1. without forcing women to major in STEM you will gonna never get \"equality\"  During early communism, we had quotas in factories for women, after about 5-8 years it was clear to everyone that the women cannot work as much and as hard as men, an the \"factory 5 year plan\" was in danger...  Then they created something called \"TESA\", meaning \"non-working workers\". These \"workers\" were in offices, and usually were part of the \"management\", but in reality it was a shitty bureaucratic system that slowed down the factory...  So they employed women in TESA positions, as most factory floor positions were men, in order to \"equalize\" the genders.   The results was this: everyone wanted the nice non-working positions, therefore no one wanted the shitty labor intensive workplaces. The factories got so bogged down by the lack of workforce that they started to pay (even in communism... imagine that) far better the manual labors than the university degree TESA workers.   Years later, a 8 class low skill manual laborer (male) could afford a car (total decadent luxury) and yearly seaside holidays (another decadent luxury) while a high skilled university degree TESA worker (usually a woman) could barely afford to live....  And the irony was that when the system collapsed, the working men, that got the best wages and best stuff (free holidays, free transportation, free food) were the ones to revolt and topple the system... not the shitty intellectuals from TESA that were too scared to do shit.   So... even if you mandate it, you still gonna get shit back. Your Marxists should learn about our past before trying it again and again and again.. like retards. \n",
      "2. \toh, and there was another result of this \"forced equality\", most intellectual women had to marry working class men, even the highest smartest had to settle for \"less\"....  Even today our \"gender gap\" in education is atrocious, far bigger than in the west, as men don't consider \"higher education\" to be necessary for them, and most women have to settle with this situation (is not like they can force men to go to school...).\n",

Long ago, they used to be about calling out the more violent and edgy aspects of incels or the more crjngey elements.    But then /r/incels went away, and the only people on IT left are bullies.  They’re those “beta” types you probably saw in school, always licking up to the popular kids and think (in a very asshole like way) that by punching down that the popular ones behind them will like them and let them orbit in their halo.   So the people that ever gave a shit about incels in any actual way disappeared and had better things to do, whereas what remains posting in IT are he sad incel type ones themselves.  So it’s bullies picking  on the angry virgins now.   Kind of like how incels were.  It went from a “woe is me” support group to an edgy “kill ‘em all” teenage angst group, which would have died out naturally, but then IT decided to be idiots, and kept the bullying up then celebrated /r/incels being closed down. “That’ll get ‘em”.   And that gave the betas, and I don’t mean alpha beta SMV memes, I mean the lower class never popular lick ups, power for he first time in their lives.  Or rather the illusion of it. So they turn into the bullies that are exactly what incels claim they face all the time.   See IT is not filled with people that have education or knowledge into psychology, sociology, or group dynamics.  They do not care who they hurt.  They do not understand that a group of online incels doesn’t really mean anything and school shootings and violence started long before internet memes were a thing. Incels would have died out on its own, or at least mulled over as more saner elements calmed them down.  Groups have a self soothing / filtered power of their own.  IT feels righteous.  They’d make an excellent religion because you always have that feeling of righteous indignation, but they’re constantly looking over their shoulder at the popular kids with a “did I do good?” look on their faces.  You can tell by their posts.    But IT is a bunch of bullies.  So they think “yeah we’ll get those MGTOWs” for that reason, but they got to keep the power hunger at bay.  So they attack us, they all do. Like David Furtelle is big on this. That fat little basement dweller is desperate for attention, so he pretends to white knight for the ladies by attacking MGTOW. He ran out of anything positive he was trying to do, and just made it a hate site because a few feminist articles referenced him and that since ofnpower and validation drives him now. Well, that and rapidly decreasing advertising revenue.   So that hunger for that tiny bit of power they’ve never had in their lives is always hungry, and they’ve desperately chased it.   So they ran out of incels, so now, they’re hoping to get that power fix by coming here, but unfortunately that just won’t work. We can’t give them the feedback response they want. So they have to start making false flag posts desperate to do some quote mining, praying for that spicy meme to post on IT for the validation they crave.  The quality of posts there and responses has rapidly declined. I mean the subreddit doesn’t even follow its own rules, and the moderators don’t follow them as well.   Kind of ironic that they act exactly like incels.  But I mean helping someone is far harder than just bullying them isn’t it.  \n",

Are you honestly trying to conflate any and all reaction to unprovoked aggression with the sjw crusade to transform existing spaces into \"safe spaces\" that adhere exclusively to their values? Because that's fucking asinine.  Apply the separation principle. Which group is willing to leave the other group alone? Which group refuses to do so and in fact demands to dominate the space created and populated by the other group?  Consider order of events. Who acted first? The gamers who simply gamed and largely ignored the leftists, the feminists, the sjws? Or was it the latter groups who launched concentrated attacks on gamers and gaming culture as \"problematic\" and \"toxic\"?  Separation principle determines who are the authoritarians. Order of events determines the morality of aggression. Equating gamers with sjws in this fashion is absurdly reductive nonsense.\n",
      "14. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI am not \"equating\" anything.  I am responding to a question that was asked earlier in this comment chain:  https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9v2wxy/youtubes_justification_for_banning_shirrako/e99bwqd/  People were discussing whether the problem with SJWs is that their ideas are fundamentally, conceptually bad, or if the problem is that they take good ideas and push them to such extremes they BECOME bad.  I contend that the problem is mostly the latter and offered the idea of safe spaces as an example.  In principle it's a reasonable idea that we advocate too, even if we don't use the same terminology.  We want our spaces, we want the places we've built to adhere to our values, we want escapism from our real life problems, we want someplace where we don't have to deal with feeling attacked as gamers.  These are fundamentally reasonable things to want.  The problem with SJWs is that they take the idea to an unreasonable extreme.  EVERYPLACE they go has to be a safe space, including places like universities that exist to train our minds and confront us with difficult, sometimes uncomfortable ideas.  And everyplace they go has to be a safe space for them and ONLY THEM, even if it means coming into other people's safe spaces, demanding it become THEIR safe space, and trying to take over and kick out the existing occupants.  That's the problem, not the existence of safe spaces in and of itself.  You are absolutely right about the separation principle, we are content to be safe in our safe space, to leave other people alone in theirs, and to suck it up and deal with the rest of the world NOT being a safe space.  They aren't, and that's the problem.  But you are kneejerk attacking an argument I am not making.\n",
      "15. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThey aren't taking the concept of a safe space to the extreme. They are wearing the concept as a mask to hide their true feelings, which are largely based in resentment and hatred.  And again, you are reducing the concept of a \"safe space\" to absurdity. A place where people are free to challenge and insult one another isn't \"safe\" for people who dislike safe spaces unless you cop to using two different definitions in the same sentence.\n",
      "16. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo challenge and insult one another on a set of terms they accept.  But again, the gamers are dead articles.  That wasn't considered acceptable.  That wasn't written off as \"you're free to challenge and insult people\".  That was considered, as you yourself put it, an attack.  And that was not okay.  Because the gaming community is supposed to be a safe space for gamers, attacking the gamer identity is not allowed without severe retaliation.\n",
      "17. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKindly point me towards the mass gamer criticism of feminism that predates the idiocy of Anita Sarkeesian.  You can't because it doesn't exist.

Your semantics are fucking retarded.\n",

      "2. \tIt's really simple:  It is against the feminist ethos to directly help men with anything but, at best, a demand that they stop hitting themselves. Feminism is legitimately and truly predicated on the idea that women have it worse in every conceivable realm than men, and any appearances to the contrary are just because of 'inaccurate lensing'.   More homeless men? It's because of men not wanting to seem womanly and seeking help. Well it's actually because women are oppressed into not committing suicide because they are so conditioned to put others' happiness before their own. More deaths on the job for men? It is again because they are conditioned to view the female condition as weak and thus equate weakness with femininity thus do not properly seek safety, and also these jobs are run by MEN.  This is not even strawmanning them. One look at \"Everything is Patriarchy\" Big Red's rhetoric will show you that, and despite her being a massive cunt and horrible person, her rhetoric is not extreme or radical relatively speaking, but rather the standard position of most feminists. \n",
      "3. \t\tYup, you should see the feminists in Finland and their official stance regarding the fact that we have conscription for men. \"Uhhh well if it's a problem you should just get rid off it. Also women's service should remain as voluntary and with higher pay because womanly needs.\"  The solution is never to extend responsibilities to women or heaven forbid give those who served a compensation so they can catch up in studies or work, at most they \"allow\" men to stop doing something unequal that is mentioned. Let's just ignore Russia and pull down our defenses like Sweden did, ignoring the fact that they only could do so because we're the buffer zone...\n",

It is PPD because she assumes that as a Female/Feminist politician she has the right to not only breach the peace but circumnavigate an entire legal system that has seen fit to deport an individual because of his actions. She has to believe either that imposing her countries values/laws, values/laws that the Afghan man accepted to adhere to upon entry, is a racist/bigoted act, or that it is not applicable on what I suspect is the basis of his skin color or refugee status, or she believes the man too feeble to understand his wrongdoing, which paradoxically is extremely bigoted to assume.\n",

According to De Becker, one important clue is \"The Unsolicited Promise,\" which is \"one of the most reliable signals because it is nearly always of questionable motive ... showing nothing more than the speaker's desire to convince you of something ... he can see that ... you have doubt [which is a messenger of intuition], likely because there is reason to doubt.\" The term \"conman\" comes from the word \"confidence\" because, knowing his intentions are not good, a conman, like a playground bully, needs to gain the confidence and trust of his intended victim. \"Always,\" De Becker goes on to say, \"in every context, be suspicious of the unsolicited promise.\"\n",

Mass immigration is a means of subverting proper democracy and the Soros types are all too eager to help it along for that reason.  Well, no.  Immigrants don't get to vote unless they're citizens, and you can't be a citizen unless you're spent at least 3 of the previous 5 years in Canada, have paid your income taxes, and have a clean criminal record both at home and in Canada.  So how does mass immigration help voting people in, exactly?  Is it a long con?  Furthermore, if it ruins the system, what's the problem with a bunch of new citizens who don't commit crimes, live in the country, and pay their taxes?  How does this subvert democracy more than, say, gerrymandering, voter manipulation through advertisements, or lobbying done by cartels, all of whom are born and raised in Canada?    It sounds like you have no fucking clue what you're talking about.  >Do you want to be a slave who can't speak up about the government as you're taxed 60% of your income so more Africans can live here?   You don't know how taxes work here do you?  I mean, in Ontario, you don't even hit 50% taxation until you're earning $942,562 a year, and even if you earn $1,000,000,000 (yes, a billion dollars in personal income in a year), the tax rate is still only 53.5%.  Hell, you don't even hit 30% until you're earning $115,531 a year.  (https://neuvoo.ca/tax-calculator/)  I mean, speak up about the government, but don't be surprised and offended when people call you a retard for saying retarded shit.  Moreover, who cares if more Africans come, so long as they pay taxes, don't commit crimes, and actually live here?  How many natural-born Canadians avoid paying taxes and are criminals?  I mean [it's already shown that immigration actually tends to reduce crime in a given area](https://crdcn.org/immigrants-and-crime-evidence-canada).  But hey, don't let facts get in the way of your feelings, snowflake.  >Are you saying that he doesn't have vested interest in bringing in a bunch of fellow African voters? Are you that divorced from political reality?   Yes.  Buddy's lived here for 25 years, longer than he's lived anywhere else.

To make this make sense to a self-important North American: culture is different in Texas than it is in Seattle.  Lousiana is not the same place as North Dakota.  America is unique in that a huge landmass is considered unified, but the states are unique.  Africa is about 30,000,000 square kilometers in size.  Europe, which we consider diverse as Spain is not the same as England, Germany, Ukraine or Russia, is 10,000,00km^2.  This is my issue with your statement about \"African Socialism\".  It's unrepresentative in that there's no unified 'africa' for it to represent.  >If immigration were handled responsibly, this would not be an issue. This is the entire point of people who want to see immigration reigned in. We know that people vote in their own interests. Their interests are going to be \"give me as much stuff as possible \". That is how resources in Africa are shared traditionally, which you will learn if you put any work into learning about it.   \"give me everything\" is pretty shortsighted and not true of all voters and voting blocks.  Again, I'm glad to see that you view Africa, the 30 million square kilometer landmass as a single, unified country, as though it were, say, France, or Belgium.  It's also a nice deflect of the problems of two-party systems, which necessarily lead to problems like this one - you get a forced ultimatum based on a single aspect of policy.    >It's not long at all. Five years is a single federal election. A million new voters minus the attrition rate as our population shrinks. If you think that this plus their irresponsible optics doesn't benefit the LPC, you're insane.   Wow, I can't believe that every single person who immigrates would then become a citizen exactly 5 years after they immigrate just to vote for the Liberals (but let's be real here - it's 2 party bullshit that would have them vote for the Liberals specifically because people like yourself are so adamant that immigrants are literally satan).    When you say \"our\" population, which do you mean?  Does this same anti-immigration view apply to people from France, England, Belgium, Sweden, Latvia, or Russia?  Do second-generation citizens, born and raised in Canada to parents from other countries, not count a citizens even though they have the same birthright claim to \"our\" population as anyone else born on Canadian soil?  Furthermore, why does the Liberal party have to be out of power at any cost?  They're problematic, absolutely, but you can pressure the party through public opinion rather than demonize and put another government in power.  I mean, that's what compromise and working democratically mean - discussion, evaluation, then decision-making.    >50% tax rate is still insane. And where do you think the money from the carbon tax and cannabis sales is actually going to go? Do you know what the asylum/refugee employment rate is?   you don't hit it unless your personal recorded income is almost $1,000,000/yr.  That's not assets or wealth, that's income.  What's more insane is thinking 1) more than 50 people in canada will reach that amount and 2) that people coming anywhere close to that don't have accounts to work around it.  The larger problem is that that tax money is actually useful.  Healthcare, education, municipal maintenance...  All of these public things need to be bought into by the public.  Crying about taxation amount says \"all I give a shit about is that I have mine and fuck you for everything else.\"  >I do if there are too many and they don't integrate before voting.   Juding by this thread, apparently 25 years is not long enough to integrate.  Apparently 5 years isn't enough to  integrate, either.  >Like I said, mass immigration screws with democracy. Traditional African values are not the same as Canadian values   Again, Africa is not a country.  It's a continent.  This is like someone from Nunavut and someone from Mexico showing up in France and the French person says they have the same \"traditional North American values\".  >and it is reflected in the infrastructure of Canada vs that in any African country. They believe in pooled resources and equal outcomes. This flies in the face of the reasoning that predicates why the West doesn't look like Fucking Somalia.   So do we.  Do you think healthcare and public education aren't a result of pooled income for equal outcomes?  If we didn't give a shit about equal outcomes, we wouldn't have public schools.  Furthermore, how do you think fucking roads would be built without pooled income?  And yet, even with these pooled resources for equal outcomes, we still don't look like Somalia.  Maybe, just maybe, there's more to this.  >That means nothing about his cultural values. He was chosen as his current role because he's Somali  Citation please.  The man's been elected to public office twice and was selected for cabinet this time.  Even if he was selected because of his background, how does that in any way invalidate his qualifications for the role?  >ergo his identity must affect his decisions. He was raised in a Somali household. If he didn't want to change Canada demographically he wouldn't be advocating for it.   To be fair, a lot of the resistance to your views on immigration comes from a hardline \"no immigration at any cost\" stance that seems to be popular these days.  It's also pretty rich to complain about Canada being changed demographically and not mentioning shit like gerrymandering or issues with real estate being used as a bank for foreign billionaires.  It's also ignorant of demographics changing due to industry meddling, like the Irving family in the Maritimes or the loss of manufacturing jobs around the country due to trade deals.  Whether you like it or not, time moves on and demographics will change anyways.  >It's a toothless fucking money sink that has done almost nothing of consequence to stop genocide and human rights violations in its most egregiously oppressive countries. It takes money from wealthy nations and redistributes it to shit holes which inflates the population and creates more dependency on the West. The reason it exists is to stop WW3 but it has no means of doing so. The War on Terror was WW3 and nobody really noticed.  those are some deeply retarded statements, but i don't give a fuck about the UN and it's outside the scope of our discussion anyways\n",

      "3. \t\tThat sentence was a true PPD. Some redditor explained why:  >Where do I even begin with your response here. Firstly, even if the video were legit, you'd still be talking about an instance of child sexual assault, where a grown woman physically took a child by the hand and forced them to touch her breasts- an act for which, if she shows enough signs of rehabilitation, she will only serve 10 years and if she fails to show enough signs of rehabilitation will only be behind bars longer than that until she does. > >However, had you been paying closer attention to the video, you would have soon discovered how dodgy it is. Had you then googled the case because things didn't add up, you would have very quickly learned that the video is full of misleading claims by the defence attorney and not only is the crime far worse than as described by her, but that her client is far from the low risk she makes her out to be. > >Firstly, I'd suggest you look at the section of the video at approximately the 0.50 second mark and pay particular attention to the time-stamping. You'll notice that it jumps from from \"4-12-10  03:35:44 PM\" to \"4-12-10  03:39:24 PM\". In short, a full 3 minutes and 40 seconds have been cut from the video; the dialogue around that cut reveals that the summations by the prosecution have been removed from it. > >So what was the uploader trying to hide and what might the defense lawyer have been lying about with the case? > >To quote from an article reporting on the appeal for this case: > >\"Thompson said Taylor had lured the victim and his younger brother over to her residence with the promise of being able to play Playstation 3. After watching TV for some time, the boy went to ask Taylor about playing the game system. Taylor, according to Thompson, closed the door to her bedroom, gently pushed the boy down onto the bed and then straddled him. > >Thompson said she then took off her hooded sweatshirt and placed the boy’s hand underneath her bra. Thompson said there was contact of her groin against his against his will, and there was skin-to-skin contact of her forcing his hand upon her breast. She then attempted to remove his clothing. Thompson said Taylor also demanded the boy have sex with her, which is contrary to other claims by the defense that she requested it.\" [http://elkodaily.com/news/local/defense-argues-unusual-punishment-in-lewdness-case/article_a32e1d84-e079-11e0-a3ec-001cc4c03286.html] > >Small surprise the kid was badly scarred by it as reported here: \" in this case it was a traumatic event. The child has needed, and continues to receive therapy.\" [http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/90976314.html] > >Clearly there was far more here than a single count of indecently assaulting a child - in fact this was attempted child rape, which falls under the very extreme end of the lewdness charge [http://www.shouselaw.com/nevada/lewd-minor.html] and if she had succeeded in raping the child, she would have gotten either a 25 year mandatory minimum or life without parole, depending on whether the victim had suffered significant bodily harm [http://www.shouselaw.com/nevada/sexual-assault.html]. > >As for this crap about her getting a lesser sentence if she'd killed the child, let's lay that myth to rest right now. There are 14 circumstances in Nevada where where first degree murder charge becomes a capital offense (punishable by lethal injection), known as \"aggravating circumstances\". > >Out of the 14, the circumstances with either automatically apply to this case, or could be argued to apply to this case, are: > >-The victim was less than fourteen years old (automatic regardless of whether the crime still took place had she killed him) >-The defendant raped or attempted to rape the victim (automatic had the crime still taken place) >-The defendant tortured or mutilated the victim (as sexual abuse could be argued to be a form of torture, could be argued to apply if the crime had still taken place) >-The defendant committed the murder to prevent an arrest or to escape custody (could have been argued to have been used to gag the victim, had the crime still taken place) >-The defendant committed the murder in the commission of robbery, first degree arson, burglary, invasion of the home, or first-degree kidnapping AND the defendant deliberately meant to kill or knew that lethal force was being used (if luring a child away under false pretenses and holding them in her bedroom against their will could be classed as abduction, and abduction argued to be equivalent to kidnapping, then it could have been argued to apply to Taylor had she killed him whilst the crime still took place). > >In short, there are 2-5 grounds out of a possible 14 set of \"special circumstances\" where her murdering the child could have justified her getting the needle. As 3 of those circumstances apply specifically to serial murders, terrorism and killing a police officer, you're essentially talking about a scenario where if she had killed the child, it covered roughly half of all the ways in which a murder is deemed heinous enough by the state of Nevada, to warrant executing the murdered. As such, not only is this claim a lie, but it is a blatant lie. > >So what about the plea bargain. The lawyer claims it was never offered, but it turns out that's also a blatant lie. > >To quote from 2 different sources: > >\"Woodbury said there were negotiations but Taylor would not plead guilty to anything considered a sex offense. > >Chad Thompson, the prosecutor on the case, said plea deals don’t necessarily have to originate at the district attorney’s office and a plea deal would have been possible if she’d agreed to plead guilty to a sex crime.\" [http://elkodaily.com/news/local/article_13eb1e20-5da7-50d7-8188-92ef3d9fc601.html] > >Furthermore the reason for this was: \"Woodbury says Taylor did not want to negotiate a plea deal because she did not want to have to register as a sex offender. Woodbury says Taylor felt her life would be over if she had to register (as a sex offender) so it wouldn't matter what she was convicted of.\" [http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/90976314.html] > >In short, recidivism was such an issue here that this convicted child rapist was so determined to avoid admitting she had a problem and trying to go under the radar, that she rejected a plea deal which would have gotten her a much lighter sentence. When recidivism is clearly that much of an issue here, how was this case even remotely mishandled? > >Are you still even remotely going to argue that the sentence here was even remotely harsh, unjust or inappropriate, given the actual facts of the case?﻿   \n",
      "4. \t\t\tAfter reading all of that, I still think a life sentence is too extreme. 20-30 years maximum should have been the punishment. From what I understand, the child was traumatised but not harmed. Sex was attempted but not done. And while she's a massive cunt for failing to admit to her crime, it's still not grounds a life sentence. If she had shown a history of attempts to multiple children, it would have been much more justified, but as far as we know, this was one attempt that traumatised a child.  It's still disgusting, and since it was attempted child rape rather than sexual abuse, it should receive a harsher sentence, but it really should be between 25 years and no more than 40.\n",

      "2. \t> Are we sure about this? If people argue for socially liberal positions such as - being pro-choice on abortion, legalisation of cannabis, rehabilitation of offenders rather than incarceration/ death penalty, legalisation of gay marriage, racial and gender equality - are they really called \"right wing\" ? Because to me, that statement seems to fly in the face of reality. I would say that people who take those positions are generally referred to as left wing or liberal, particularly by right wing commentators.  I was specifically referring to free speech absolutism. That's a liberal position. It has been redefined as \"right wing\" in today's culture war, by those who consider themselves progressive leftists.  >This one is very easy to debunk. Here's a link to a report on how Amnesty International (usually regarded as a liberal organisation) has campaigned against FGM and the treatment of women in Islamic societies.  Sure. But when people like Ayaan Hirsi Ali do the same thing they're accused of being \"right wing extremists.\" As is Maajid Nawaz even though he's of the moderate left. Even Christopher Hitchens, who was a *literal Trotskyist*, got accused of being an 'extreme right winger' for his stances on the Islamic world's treatment of gays and women.   Sure, maybe it doesn't happen every time. But you can't pretend that people who express concern over how bad civil liberties are in the Islamic world and suggest that perhaps Islam, at least in the form in which it is most prominent, is standing in the way of liberalization/modernization *don't* get accused of being racist or xenophobic or \"right-wingers.\"  >Here's a story about Femen - again definitely a left wing organisation - protesting treatment of women in Islamic societies.  I am not familiar with Femen but from what little I've heard they don't count as a mainstream/'official' organ of the establishment left. \n",

You only have to spend a bit of time in a multi cultural society to see that this is nonsense. The experience you will gain, backed with factual statistics, will show you that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and simply want to be left alone to get on with their lives. When people start making claims that \"all\" Muslims are jihadists, or being Muslim inherently means you are a violent extremist, or follow an extremist ideology - that's when you will get called racist, xenophobic or right-wing.   >I am not familiar with Femen but from what little I've heard they don't count as a mainstream/'official' organ of the establishment left.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Maajid Nawaz and even *Tommy Fucking Robinson* frequently make clear they aren't talking about all Muslims, and they frequently distinguish between \"Islamists\" and \"most Muslims in the west.\" They still get called \"radical racist xenophobic right-wingers.\"  >The experience you will gain, backed with factual statistics, will show you that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and simply want to be left alone to get on with their lives.   The factual statistics also suggest that a very large percentage of Muslims are socially and theologically conservative, and would favor laws that restrict our civil liberties in the name of their religion. A survey of British Muslims found that a *supermajority* thought homosexuality should be criminalized.  Sure, they aren't necessarily *jihadists*. But if you believe in forcing society to live by Islamic norms *even via the ballot box* then you're an Islamist (\"Jihadists\" are Islamists who support terrorism as a means to forcing society to live by Islamic norms).   Yes, there are many Muslims whom are not Islamists. But we need to take the problem seriously. We saw the theocratic nonsense spouted by the religious right back in the George W Bush administration for the *threat it was*, and we didn't make excuses for them like \"but they're nonviolent, they want a democratic process to restrict our rights.\" Islamists should be viewed with the same suspicion, if not more, that was cast upon the Dominionists.  >When people start making claims that \"all\" Muslims are jihadists, or being Muslim inherently means you are a violent extremist, or follow an extremist ideology - that's when you will get called racist, xenophobic or right-wing.  Again, not even Tommy Robinson supports that viewpoint. In addition, some people are *very eager to conflate* the proposition that \"some verses in the Quran and some theological positions that are prominent in the Islamic world logically support Jihadists\" with the proposition that \"all Muslims are violent extremists.\" Take a look at how Sam Harris was treated by Ben Affleck.   >Do you have a list of \"official\" organs of the \"establishment left\"?

So are right-wing US Christians who believe that either homosexuality or abortion should be illegal, Christianists? They might never take part in any sort of activism to force their view on people, but there's no evidence to say that this \"supermajority\" of Muslims would do so, either (and in fact there is circumstantial evidence which shows they don't).   Tommy Robinson may stop short of literally saying \"All Muslims are jihadists\" or \"all Muslims are extremists\" but he virtually says it, with weasel words. His (and others like him) line is \"Muslim is an extremist ideology\". Which has the implication that anyone who follows it is an extremist, whereas in fact the vast majority of Muslims clearly do not follow Islam to extremist lengths.   >Think \"major, center-left social-democratic political parties,\" left-leaning MSM outlets, and most academics.  I am sure you know full well that this is entirely subjective. Outlets like HuffPo and Guardian are generally considered \"left-leaning MSM\" but among right wing/alt-right circles they are often referred to as \"far left\" or even \"extremist\".  As an example of how this also occurs on the right, Milo Yiannopolis works well - Milo is often at great pains to point out that he considers his views to be conservative-centrist, and in no way extreme. There are plenty on the left though, who considers some of the key beliefs he espouses - such as Muslims not being welcome in the West, and feminism being a dangerous ideology - as \"far right\".   Personally I think a good indicator of whether an opinion/belief is extreme or moderate, is whether it involves imposing your will on other people.  Hence \"Abortion should be illegal\" = extreme While \"Everyone should have the choice whether or not to engage in abortion\" = moderate.   That's a big part of the reason why I consider myself a liberal/progressive, rather than a conservative. To me, the liberal/progressive option is more often than not the one which involves giving people a choice, while the conservative/reactionary position is one which involves removing choice.

      "6. \t\t\t\t\t>So are right-wing US Christians who believe that either homosexuality or abortion should be illegal, Christianists?   Yes. If they wish to legislatively enforce their religious moral beliefs, they are Christianists. We've critiqued and lampooned the Religious Right, quite justifiably, for decades in the West. But the Islamic equivalent doesn't get treated with the same scorn.  >They might never take part in any sort of activism to force their view on people, but there's no evidence to say that this \"supermajority\" of Muslims would do so, either  The Religious Right has indeed tried to commandeer the State to enforce their policy preferences on others.

His (and others like him) line is \"Muslim is an extremist ideology\".

Tommy Robinson isn't someone with multiple college degrees. He's not going to speak in an highly precise, polished, educated manner on the subject and it reeks of classism to basically demand he do so. Yes, he knows not all Muslims are Islamists, he knows the distinction and has affirmed it at multiple times.   You say he's using \"weasel words\" but if you want to condemn activists for not using sufficiently qualified, nuanced language, Tommy Robinson is a relatively mild offender.   It isn't wrong to say that Islam, if by \"Islam\" we're speaking in terms of popularly and widely embraced interpretations and understandings thereof, does indeed contain tenets which don't precisely fit in nicely with modern western cosmopolitan pluralistic liberal democracy.   When we were critiquing the religious right, we made *absolutely no bones* about citing \"clobber verses\" from their holy texts and pointing out that these stood in the way of them embracing a tolerant interpretation of their religion. We also very rarely brought out huge levels of theological nuance, we rarely took great pains to distinguish between denominations, and we didn't get called bigots for doing so (except by the religious right themselves, whom are not taken seriously).  Why, pray tell, is the *same treatment* some unfathomable bigotry?  Yes, I know about the Mu'tazilites, and I know there are the Ibadis and the Ahmadis blah blah blah, but you can't *bitch about linguistics* as a way to get around the fact that in today's world, *an extremely large proportion of Muslims are Salafist or Deobandist*. Are you going to bitch about Tommy not being able to cite Averroes' views on the number of angels that could stand on a pinhead? Or are you going to actually confront the meat of the criticism?   >I am sure you know full well that this is entirely subjective. Outlets like HuffPo and Guardian are generally considered \"left-leaning MSM\" but among right wing/alt-right circles they are often referred to as \"far left\" or even \"extremist\".

No surprises there.  >Personally I think a good indicator of whether an opinion/belief is extreme or moderate, is whether it involves imposing your will on other people. Hence \"Abortion should be illegal\" = extreme While \"Everyone should have the choice whether or not to engage in abortion\" = moderate.  Well then by that definition I'm perfectly moderate, since I'm a libertarian.

And the fact that a huge slice of the 'progressive' left thinks that free speech is a cis het white male conspiracy to oppress others. The liberal tradition cares about individual choice... the Progressive tradition, which is rooted ultimately in the works of the totalitarian Auguste Comte, is not in favor of individual choice. \n",

That seems to be what you are implying - however in the case of Tommy I don't think he lacks education. The basic fundamentals of the issue are not complex, you don't need a college degree in sociology or theology to understand the principles. Tommy isn't conventionally educated but he isn't stupid, he knows what he is doing. Hence my phrase \"weasel words\".   >When we were critiquing the religious right, we made absolutely no bones about citing \"clobber verses\" from their holy texts and pointing out that these stood in the way of them embracing a tolerant interpretation of their religion.

Why, pray tell, is the same treatment some unfathomable bigotry?  I don't believe it is unfathomable bigotry. As a liberal progressive, I am quite happy to say that I think a lot of the principles of fundamentalist Islam are utterly abhorrent, and incompatible with modern, liberal society and values. I know for a fact all of my liberal progressive friends would say the same thing. We are quite happy to say that, for example, killing gay people for being gay, forcing women to cover their faces in public, stoning adulterers, etc, are barbaric and wrong. I truly don't know any liberal who would dispute this, or fail to speak out about it.   The idea that liberals DO excuse, or fail to speak out over, such issues, is, in my opinion, a right wing conspiracy which is used to muster opposition to the left wing/ progressive political viewpoints.  What left wing/progressives take issue with, is right wing political views which imply that ALL Muslims agree with those horrible and totalitarian ideals, and in particular with those that try to say that this \"fact\" means that Muslims shouldn't be in western / non-Islamic countries.   You might say that you don't believe in that level of extremism - perhaps you personally are happy for \"moderate\" muslims to live in, and integrate with (while maintaining their own cultural heritage, to the extent that it doesn't impinge on anyone else's freedoms) western societies. But you just need to go and look at comments on, say, Breitbart articles, or listen to the anti-Muslim rantings of Milo or Coulter, to see that the viewpoint that they should be entirely barred from the west (or indeed wiped from the face of the Earth altogether) is fairly established and unchallenged amongst the \"right\".   I am open minded enough to be able to see that there are elements of totalitarianist thought on the left - due to the fact that at the end of the day, society needs laws, to some extent, in order to function, and laws inevitably boil down to rights being restricted and freedoms being impinged.   However in my opinion the extent of the left's totalitarianism extends to limiting people's absolute freedom of speech, when that speech has the potential to incite hate or harm against others. And issues such as requiring businesses to hire and fairly pay minorities.   The extent of totalitarianism proposed by the right - no abortions, no homosexuality, forced repatriation or even extermination of non-whites (again YOU may not believe in this, but from comments on right wing outlets like BB its undeniable that many have these views) are far more horrifying in the extent of totalitarianism that is proposed. \n",

Divide and conquer tactics. Not only that but you're completely inaccurate. The alt-lite, and even the alt-right, habitually go out of their way to transgress and shock the sensibilities of the religious right. Milo has openly rejected the religious right and is himself flamboyantly gay and married to a man, he's spoken about how he was a fan of Marilyn Manson back during the previous culture war, etc. Much of the alt-right is pro-abortion, some of it (including Richard Spencer himself) is accepting of gay people, and the entire alt-right worldview is incompatible with Conservative Christianity as it exists in the USA (the alt-right being rather anti-semitic whilst conservative Christians are philo-semitic).  Not to mention, *conservative Christianity is in both political and demographic decline*. Younger evangelicals, by the way, are less anti-gay than their elders, so the \"conservative Christians\" are being less conservative every day.   Your package-dealing of \"liberalism and progressivism\" is outright wrong on every level.  >Is it really \"classist\" to disagree with someone because you don't think they are educated enough to understand what they're talking about?   Its classist to immediately dismiss them as racist because they don't use sufficiently eloquent terminology.

Tommy isn't conventionally educated but he isn't stupid, he knows what he is doing. Hence my phrase \"weasel words\".  Would you consider Douglas Murray racist then? Or bigoted? What about Bruce Bawer? Because I don't see them making substantially different arguments, they just use more educated language to do so.   >I don't believe it is unfathomable bigotry. As a liberal progressive, I am quite happy to say that I think a lot of the principles of fundamentalist Islam are utterly abhorrent, and incompatible with modern, liberal society and values.

Apart from Pamela Geller and perhaps Milo, I don't know anyone who says this. Douglas Murray doesn't. Tommy Robinson doesn't. Harris and Dawkins don't. Christopher Hitchens never did. Maajid Nawaz doesn't (indeed, he's a Muslim). Ayaan Hirsi Ali doesn't (and she specifically repudiates such positions in her book *Heretic*). Almost all of these figures have been accused of \"racism\" and \"islamophobia\" however, by certain people on the left.  >But you just need to go and look at comments on, say, Breitbart articles  Yes, comments on Breitbart articles are a fucking dumpster fire. But its exceptionally unlikely that *comments on Breitbart articles* will become the guiding lights of policy within the West. You know those people are exceptionally fringe.  >the viewpoint that they should be entirely barred from the west (or indeed wiped from the face of the Earth altogether) is fairly established and unchallenged amongst the \"right\".  As someone who's been a libertarian for decades, has spoken with people from the left and the right, the idea that there should be a *blanket ban on all Islamic immigration into the west* is *anything but* accepted orthodoxy on the right. At most, I see arguments for civic values tests, enhanced screenings for links to terrorism, and in some cases temporary quantity caps or temporary pauses. And are you *fucking kidding me* about the idea that \"wiping Muslims off the face of the earth\" is somehow accepted orthodoxy on the right?!? *Libertarians, Paleoconservatives and Trumpists are all less interventionist than Neoconservatives* so that's even *less* likely to happen.   One or two ranters on *Breitbart* says nothing about actual policy platforms.   >I am open minded enough to be able to see that there are elements of totalitarianist thought on the left - due to the fact that at the end of the day, society needs laws, to some extent, in order to function, and laws inevitably boil down to rights being restricted and freedoms being impinged.  That's not an open-minded viewpoint at all. Its a phony attempt at balance and you know it. The proper role of law is to *ensure* rights by prohibiting the *violation* of them. There is no \"right to murder\" and thus laws against murder do not violate anyone's rights.   Yes, society needs laws, but that's a vacuous truth.   You're ignoring the absurdly long history of totalitarianism on the left; every form of Marx-inspired ideology degenerated into totalitarianism. 20s/30s/40s progressivism, an ideology of the left, was essentially fascism with pseudoscientific pretentions. Auguste Comte was hardly a right-winger and his philosophy has been absurdly influential on the technocratic left; Comte was a devout totalitarian.   >However in my opinion the extent of the left's totalitarianism extends to limiting people's absolute freedom of speech, when that speech has the potential to incite hate or harm against others.   \"Incite\" has a very particular meaning in law. It requires the advocacy of imminent lawless conduct. The left's proposed limitations on freedom of speech are much, much broader and include even books like Charles Murray's *The Bell Curve* (which is controversial but hardly inciteful).   >The extent of totalitarianism proposed by the right - no abortions, no homosexuality  Bullshit. Again, there are libertarians (mostly pro-abortion, universally accepting of private sexual conduct), many of the populist-nationalist parties are pro-choice (for example Pauline Hanson's One Nation party in Australia... Hanson supports abortion on request), and the gay marriage issue is basically settled. The upcoming generation of Evangelical Christians are not only less numerous than the last, but also more accepting on gay marriage.  >from comments on right wing outlets like BB its undeniable that many have these views  And these people aren't making the policy. Hell, they're more extreme than Breitbart's own writers.  -----  Your entire screed is nothing more than an attempt to deny the fact that the culture war has radically changed. You're still pretending that there are radical dominionists in the wings, when the reality is that the contemporary right has become substantially more secular and in some ways much more socially liberal than it used to be. As even Angela Nagle... an old leftist and author of *Kill All Normies* pointed out... the Alt-Right (and she was talking about the *actual* Alt-Right, not people like Sargon of Akkad) is a right wing completely devoid of Christian morality.  Trying to wave 90s-era culture war flags makes no sense in today's world. \n",

And I fully agree.   But, I honestly think you are trying to paint a picture of a new, improved, updated right-wing - accepting of gays, accepting of personal freedoms when it comes to issues such as abortion etc... which at best, is simply a thinly veneered attempt to attract \"new blood\" by throwing out some of the ideas that simply aren't going to wash in the modern world (eg - Milo being \"flamboyantly gay\" - while at the same time taking an anti-gay stance on just about every gay rights issue - such as gay marriage which, even though he has indulged in it himself, he claims should be \"called something else\".)  And at worst (in the case of the far-right) is exactly the same as the old-right has always been.  You have to admit, the so-called new, \"liberal\" right wing which you are trying to convince me exists, and the old fashioned Bible-thumping, cross-burning right-wing have an awful lot in common - Love of Trump, hatred of feminism, hatred of Islam, rejection of #metoo, belief in traditional gender roles, willingness to engage in conspiracy theories (Pizza Gate, Sandy Hook being a false flag) and, as we're discussing this on a Gamergate subreddit, hatred of Anita Sarkeesian/Zoe Quinn.   And if we include Breitbart readers/commenters (who certainly would include themselves, and I don't really think you can exclude them simply because they don't fit your idea of what constitutes the \"new right\"), then we can include white nationalism in the mix, too.  Breitbart, by the way, to some extent, represents the more moderate end of the \"far right\" - I could easily have cited Andrew Anglin or Richard Spencer - outright white nationalists.    You may say they are different, but they are unequivocally the same in many ways. So it's really just a PR exercise.   \n",

First off, Milo *changed his stance* on the gay marriage issue when he fell in love and got married. He's recently said he thinks the only reason people would deny same-sex couples the right to a civil marriage is pure cruelty. He changed his former stance and admitted it.  Obama evolved. So did Milo.  Not to mention, opposition to gay marriage *used to be prevalent on the radical left*. Indeed, the radical queer left used to see gay marriage as attempted cultural assimilation, and as the introduction of patriarchal and heteronormative institutions into queer culture. Indeed, it was the work of *gay conservatives and moderates* like Andrew Sullivan and Bruce Bawer that first popularized the idea of gay marriage (read *A Place At The Table* and *Virtually Normal*).   Why does the radical left get a pass, with their arguments *not* besmirching or invalidating the left, but Bawer and Sullivan somehow indicate nothing at all about changing perspectives on the right?  Finally, your entire argument so far has *systematically ignored the existence of ideological libertarians*. After all, they complicate the simplistic Manichean narrative of \"if you support abortion rights and same-sex marriage rights you must undyingly support the Democrats because All Republicans Are Evil\" you're trying to weave.   >You have to admit, the so-called new, \"liberal\" right wing which you are trying to convince me exists, and the old fashioned Bible-thumping, cross-burning right-wing have an awful lot in common - Love of Trump,  Trump is the most socially liberal Republican candidate in decades, a thrice-married foul-mouthed philanderer who has publically questioned aspects of the war on drugs and interventionist foreign policy, and who triangulated *to the left* on issues of international economics to capture a traditionally-Democratic constituency (the Rust Belt working class) and thus win the Presidency.  Yeah... extremist right wing, huh? In addition, his immigration policy works out to labor protectionism and both Sanders and Hillary wanted more border enforcement too.   >hatred of feminism,   Equivocation. Feminism isn't a monolith.

I'm against contemporary feminism *because it isn't anti-traditionalist enough*.   >hatred of Islam,   George W Bush was frequently at pains to emphasize he wasn't at war with Islam, only Terrorism, and that he regarded Islam as a \"religion of peace.\" Not to mention the New Atheist movement was dominated by liberals and leftists yet was quite critical of many aspects of Islam.   >rejection of #metoo,   Belief in due process and the presumption of innocence is a right-wing position now? Not to mention, #MeToo was started in response to allegations about the sexual misconduct of Harvey Weinstein, and a *huge number of conservatives gleefully celebrated the downfall of a huge Hillary donor*.   >belief in traditional gender roles,   On this you're mostly right, however by the same token people on the left consistently accuse Men's Human Rights Activists and MGTOWs of being \"right-wing\". Yet both the MHRM and MGTOW are founded on a *rejection* of traditional masculine gender roles. The actual alt-right are traditionalists, I concede that.  >willingness to engage in conspiracy theories (Pizza Gate, Sandy Hook being a false flag)  Yes, and the left *never* believes in conspiracy theories at all! Oh what fucking rot. Nancy MacLean's *Democracy In Chains* is a left-wing conspiracy theory promoted by a Duke University historian for fuck's sake.

Guilt by association. Anyone can comment on Breitbart. Not to mention, the editorial line and positions of *Breitbart* are determined by Breitbart's *authors* rather than *readers*.   >I could easily have cited Andrew Anglin or Richard Spencer - outright white nationalists.  Ahh yes, Andrew Anglin... the guy who declared Holy War against Milo Yiannopoulos. Ethno-nationalism... the ideology that rejects civic nationalism as cuckery, and liberal individualism as a Jewish conspiracy.  Please, please let me know how support for a classically liberal civic nationalism built on individualism and the values of the Enlightenment *somehow equates to supporting the alt-right... a movement that rejects enlightenment individualism, civic nationalism and classical liberalism*.   >You may say they are different, but they are unequivocally the same in many ways.  By the same reasoning I could say that Progressivism is unequivocally the same as Nazism. Pretty much every feature you cite as evidence that people like (for example) Paul Joseph Watson are no different to KKK members is an ideological inessential that has nothing to do with the actual content of a political philosophy.  >So it's really just a PR exercise.  Just like your posts. You still are in denial that the boundaries of the culture wars have radically shifted. You're still trying to demand that undying support for every excess of the contemporary left be the price of accepting social liberalism. You still seem to think fundamentalist Christians are waiting in the wings even though their influence and numbers are in drastic decline. You still seem to think that the Donkey Party is the party of civil liberties and cultural permissiveness, even though they're using hyperoffended feminists as an army of censorious church ladies and as advocates against due process.   By no means would I suggest that anyone who is a \"true\" social liberal should vote straight Republican. There are Democrats who have preserved a devotion to civil liberties and cultural liberalism. It is you, on the other hand, who is trying to reinforce the outright lie that Sex, Drugs and Rock & Roll are the exclusive property of the Donkey Party. \n",

      "Row 1317, Column 'text' has multiple consecutive spaces: '1. To the guy who was calling the fans entiled little shits and deleted his comment, here’s my fucking reply to you and anyone else who thinks that way:  Blizzcon’s audience are hardcore fans, and hardcore diablo fans have always been mainly PC Gamers. You can add console gamers too with D3.  If you seriously don’t understand why telling this to your most hardcore fans who have waited over 5 years for any news regarding a Diablo project isn’t retarded then you are. Add to that the fact these guys fucking paid hundreds for a ticket and thousands to travel and stay there only to get a slap on the face. Not to mention the fucking video they released hyping this turd up saying it was a good time to be a diablo fan just to sell more con tickets.  A mobile game is not what any established Diablo fan wants for several reasons. I won’t go into detail because they should be fucking obvious if you used your brain but here’s a small list: predatory monetization and mtx, game limited by hardware capacity of phones, gameplay simplified to work with a touchscreen for a controller, etc. Oh and the fucking company they partnered with that developed the abomination has a horrible history of p2w games.  People aren’t fucking entitled, they’re rightfully pissed at how something they love is being dragged through the mud and how the head of marketing at Blizzard appears to be a dropped on the head as a baby orangutan. So yes, you are totally off the mark regarding your assesment.  And if you even have to ask why the journos that are in bed with developers and get info plus money from them are defending them I doubt you’ve even been here long. They have already demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt they don’t give a shit about their readers and gamers in general.  I’ll be a whiny little bitch according to your opinion any day over letting Blizz spit on my face and ruin a franchise I love without saying anything.\n",
      "2. \tTo be blunt, here's what happened. Blizzard built up hype for a new PC Diablo game so they could transfer the hype over to this mobile thing. This is always a terrible horrible idea. It never works. PR and marketing people need to stop doing this. It just creates a ton of anger, quite frankly, justifiably.   Companies have a role to play in setting proper expectations. When they fuck up these expectations, people get upset. If they don't want people to get upset, then they need to work to maintain proper expectations. \n",
      "3. \t\thell if blizzard wanted a damn diablo game you could play on smartphones so badly, just port the first game to smartphones, that probably would have gone ALOT more smoothly, you would have gotten at least a mixed reaction...not every gamer, even non diablo fans effectively telling blizzard to get fucked.\n",
      "4. \tThis is the part that people don't focus on enough: the insulting way the news was delivered. The fact that Blizzard is making mobile apps out of their main IP lineup is disappointing and worrying, but ok, it's their products. But they announced before Blizzcon they have exciting Diablo news, gathered people in front of the stream, the more loyal fans bought the digital ticket to be sure not to miss any panel, the most hardcore ones paid for travel and Blizzcon tickets to be there in person... Only then they said \"We have nothing for you. We have a product for a completely different audience and will mock you for being confused/disappointed. Fuck you.\"\n",
      "5. \t\tI think that is the main thing.  It was downright deceptive of them.  I don't care if they make mobile games out of their franchises.  I will just ignore those and move on with my life... but that they act as if they have a big announcement to a blizzcon style fanbase and then have it be that was just nasty.\n",
      "6. \t\tAnd they waited until it was too late for anyone to back out or have second thoughts to be like \"woah guys, hold your horses, don't get *too* excited (despite how hype we have been)\" to try and have some deniability after.\n",
      "7. \t\tIt was pretty funny when the developer blamed the backlash on Trump. He ended up deleting the tweet.  https://i.imgur.com/sTYUMy4.jpg\n",
      "8. \t\tThis is probably the first time they announce a game that isn't theirs in BlizzCon. Blizzard has always had pride for their event and their games (which is why they have so few IP's).  Let that sink in.\n",
      "9. \t> Blizzcon’s audience are hardcore fans  In the past I would have agreed.  Now it's just a casual/cosplayer party for people that first learned about Blizzard during D3 or one of the WoW xpacs.\n",
      "10. \t\tYou say that, but would that audience boo them when they said the game wouldn't come out on PC?\n",

An incredibly irresponsible move. An apology is in order.  Huh...   That's weird.  There are so many contradictions, I don't even know where to start.  The lack of European only subsidized housing demonstrates systemic racism, because they to can also want to live in a \"culturally appropriate setting\", and your refusal to do so is bigotry.  Wanting to live in a segregated tax-payer subsidized Islamic enclave after you immigrate to a multicultural pluralist society isn't culturally appropriate for Canada, so it isn't the right setting to do so.   Demanding an apology for allowing someone to speak while you support segregated housing is fucking insane.   Thinking participating in an open debate of ideas is worse than rioting, destruction of property, and attacking law enforcement officers is retarded. It also justifies violence anywhere someone you disagree with is speaking. I wonder if he'd have the same position for a riot at a Linda Sarsour speaking event...   If their cultures are so backwards and violent that we need to take in hundreds of thousands of them every year, why should we also encourage the wholesale importation and preservation of a culture they needed to be allowed to enter Canada to flee?

It's almost verbatim an excuse used to keep black people out of white neighbourhoods in the south in the 50s.  Literally, \"we think they'd feel more comfortable among their own\".  Cressy literally is mouthing those same words, and worse he had time to think and come up with this line of argument.  And the double down on that, and to then flip the problem as to say that the only problem is that we don't have MORE segregation sufficient for everyone's bigotry, shows you how little repercussion white liberals face for their bigotry.     The left is the home of racism and bigotry today, it's just insane.\n",

I think it's wonderful to make dreams come true.   The problem is, this woman was not just expressing her beliefs. She is a political activist and a politician. She is taking action and she is rather successful at doing so, even if her current event was foiled so spectacularly.

There can be no communism without gulags, no nazis without aushwitz and I believe that third option will have similar inevitable consequence. People pushing all three options always believe that they are the lucky ones who will avoid getting the short end of the stick. Someone random innocent bystander will get hurt, but they won't. It is unfair. If fulfilling your belief results in hurting large group of people, you deserve to be one of those people. \n",

They've proven individual firms in Russia generate these on the subjects of race, gander, LGBT, and politics. They post as right and left. It doesn't matter. The only goal is to make us hate each other. The US just charged a woman last week for doing this trying to affect the 2018 election. So crazy that the US is being turned on itself by memes and social media posts. What was it T/d used to call it, meme magic?  \n",

This is fucking retarded and we need to quit pretending it's not just to \"get back at those mean old entitled women\". 17 year olds want to and are perfectly capable of having sex. Male and female. Enough with the petty bullshit.\n",
      "2. \tJust because he’s perfectly capable of having sex doesn’t mean those laws aren’t in place for good reasons. She’s his teacher, she’s in a position of power which automatically makes it questionable. Besides that any grown person that preys on teens/children should be seen as just that. Predatory. \n",

      "4. \t\t\tAnd if he was 18 it would be predatory as well. That is the simple nature of a relationship where someone is still under 20 and the other one is nearly twice the age. Or having relations with your students as a teacher.   You might think it it ridiculous, that is your opinion. But that doesn’t change the nature of such a relationship. People develop and change a lot during those years.   Edit: you’re assuming that I’m basing this line on age because it is legal at 18. I’m basing this on the fact that someone that is 17-18 doesn’t have the same emotional maturity as a 30-something year old. \n",
      "5. \t\t\t\tOkay, I'm seeing what your saying. However I don't buy the emotional maturity thing. Humans are fully ready for sex at puberty and have been for tens of thousands of years. I know things are a tad different for us now with society and all but a 17 just having sex with someone older isn't gonna scar them. Unless he didn't want too and she forced him with threats or violence or something like that, he's gonna fondly remember that experience for the rest of his life. Trust me on that one.\n",
      "6. \t\t\t\t\tYou don’t have to “buy” it. It’s just a fact. It’s also not about the sex itself, it’s the whole nature of a sexual relationship. A person of twelve can get pregnant, that does not mean it’s okay for an adult to have a sexual relationship with that twelve year old. The appear to nature is the weakest argument one can make because it’s not just a “tad different”. There are a lot of things humans did when we still lived in the Stone Age, that doesn’t mean it’s right. We’ve changed this because of our current understanding of humans development, whether you “buy” that or not.\n",

Also she was a teacher in a position of power.  So it's not like they randomly met at the mall.  She knew the law, and she understood the consequences.  But she decided to get her turkey stuffed by a underage student anyway.  Instead of simply waiting for a year.  I don't feel the least bit bad for her.\n",

A big tell in a flawed story is if your introduce a key conflict--it may not  be the main conflict, it may only be the second or third conflict--but if it's a key conflict to the story, and it's resolved by some lazy deus ex machina (in this instance, dei ex machina embodied in Shazam), that resolves a critical conflict...the story is flawed.     One of the big conceits of the book was that there was this prophecy about the bat and the eagle in conflict.   through three issues it was implied it was Bats v Supes, then SHAZAM PLOT TWIST, it's Bats v Wonder Woman, and in issue four they're duking it out and SHAZAM! instead of resolving the intractable conflict between side A and side B...humans decide to nuke super humans (thus ending the conflict between Bats and WW...which was a freaking prophecy and treated as critical to the story up to that point) and Supes and a brainwashed Shazam have to stop the bomb (and half fail in doing so).   Ok.  You ended the Bats v WW conflict with a distraction.  It's a freaking Elseworlds story.  You are given the license to have consequences.   Let key characters die.   Let one side win.  Have cajones.   Re.  Solve.  The.  Con.  Flict.    Waid is tame.  His personal antics have more drama and consequences than his fiction.  Dude could never create anything new, write some science fiction novel, build a universe.  He's a fanboy that was competent in managing the month to month tension of comic book writing, but good at nothing else.  Neil Gaiman could invent and write outside of comics.  Joe Hill.  Even Kevin Smith, who started in film then went to comics in back.  That's impressive.    But these fanboy writers are just dull hacks (Waid, Busiek).  I don't need grim and gritty or anti-grim and gritty or any theme or motif, just invention and creativity.   I never, ever understood why those fanboy writers were put on a pedestal in the mid to late 90s.  Tame writers.  They're the same quality as Roy Thomas, with the exception that Roy a) actually created new borderline A lister characters (Vision) and quality B listers (Black Knight) (Waid and Busiek have done neither), B) Thomas was responsible for much of the Marvel Universe webbing, creating connections across character families that created the networked feel of the Marvel U in the 70s  (see what he did with Asgard and the Eternals and Ragnarok...pretty ingenious for comic writing) and carried in the 80s (that even Lee and Kirby (the creators) failed to do), and C) isn't worshipped as a god like Waid and Busiek are.    I'm listening to Scriver's broadcast yesterday on Waid and DinC, and yikes....I'm torn between wanting these stories about Waid to be true and not be true, because if they are true, man, what a despicable human being (him and Dan Slott) and if not true, then that type of trolling accusations just degrade society further (in our anonymous cyber/accusation oriented culture, I don't know what to believe is true when people speak roughly anonymously about others...makes me a skeptic).   \n",

I felt bad for you and tried to take care of you so you could live while I die. Look how you treated me.   Thanks for proving the stereotype of medicaid patients.

Reddit is just one site and the hivemind isnt even real because we all think differently whether it seems we all agree or not.  Besides Reddit isnt the only place that consolidates a single ideology.  *cough* 4chan *cough*  Even then ppl on reddit are pretty centrist in their policies too.  I generally don't see anything thats too overexxagerated.  And if i do i see ppl call it out.  There are fringe groups for everything and like i said they are always the loudest.  Perhaps its because we want to notice them because we are fascinated in watching train wrecks or perhaps the fringe are just very passionate about their cause compared to the sensical.  Regardless this is all anecdotal from my view but i think you and all redditors are crazy and should chill out.  Besides, conservatives have their own version of sjws as well.  Doesnt make it right but sjws aint special or worse.  \n",
      "9. \t\t\t\t\tI’m not certain it’s as small a minority as you think and I believe you’re downplaying how absurd the far left has become. It’s more widespread and apparent then a random lunatic posting here and there.  I’ve been called a racist hillbilly nazi by a plethora of people on reddit simply for my username (which is just jest ) and the fact that I hold somewhat “conservative “ political views. You see it on twitter etc all the time.   Candace Owens  being bashed and having racist insults thrown her way by WHITE antifa members for being a conservative. Kayne being labeled as “ not black “ because he “supports “ trump ... those are just two quick examples.  How often do you see CNN/MSNBC condemning ANTIFA ? (a self admitted stateside terrorist Group)   Have you been to r/politics ? Literally just try and post something semi positive about trump or conservatives/ republicans in general ... or try to “defend” some ignorant meme that is put up and instead of a debate you’re immediately labeled as a racist “alt righter “  Posts are not even allowed if it’s in any way negative to liberals/ Obama/ Hilary etc. If you make a comment pointing out faults with the liberal establishment etc you’re also called a racist  nazi etc ... it’s quite troublesome and honestly just downright ignorant   It’s especially comical considering everyone just automatically assumes my race/ethnicity .  The Alt-left has just gone completely bonkers.  That being said I truly do hope more liberals  are similar to you than the loud vocal Alt-Left groups we do often hear/witness. \n",
      "10. \t\t\t\t\t\tIm not even liberal.  I dont like subscribing to labels or parties because i just like being who i am.    And reddit is still a minority.  I really think you're also over exaggerating how populer the \"alt-left\" is.    And while i don't agree with them, you can't just ignore the right's fringe group either because they're just as loud.  The Alt-Right is also a huge problem like the Alt-Left.    However while i wanna believe about your harassment for your name.  I haven't seen that shit.  At least not as a top comment which means both the harassed and harasser get downvoted at least the majority of the time.  I also dont frequent r/politics for minor news.  I also view r/asktrumpsupporters but i can no longet post there because i was banned for agreeing with a user when they told me i should kill myself over an opinion.  I think thats why i got banned.  Either way, i do listen to conservatives.  My friend is a fiscal conservative.  I can agree with some of his policies.  I do believe social conservatism is utter garbage where a bunch of old religious people are just afraid of change and personal freedom.  (Yes, abortion is a hot subject but i think the mother's decision matters more.  Altho nobody gets abortion in the 3rd trimester where it really becomes morally wrong)  I feel like I went off topic.    Regardless most ppl ive met, friends, family, and bar patrons who lean left, are pretty centrist if not reasonably sensical.    However, i do have to say the left are not the only path in the street nor are they the biggest.  Look at every election in the past 30 years. Its been pretty split which is honestly a good thing.  One party rulings would cause chaos.  Antifi really isnt that popular either.  I rarely hear anything good about them aside from reddit.  They're like the right's Neo Nazi problem.  I feel like just like the left and everyone else you go searching for problems to validate your fears.  The internet isnt the real world.  Get out and meet people outside.  Then you will really see people's opinions.  I also live in Wisconsin, a heavy purple state now no thanks to Scott fucking Walker.  Excuse me, sorry.\n",
      "11. \t\t\t\t\t\tYou think they’re more prevalent because you’re bombarded by every tiny example of the behaviour you mentioned, on right wing forums, subs, news sources, talk radio, YouTube channel etc. All right wing sources conflate the existence of these people to make sure you not only keep voting conservative but view the opposition as evil, “unhinged” sycophants to ensure that, for fear of being associated with them, you never vote with them and always against the best interests of the majority of the population.\n",
      "12. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere may be less of them than many would think but  they are excelent at infiltration and they are unhinged, It doesnt matter if there is 4 milions of them in USA when they got massive corporate support are willing to cross any rule and they get protected from consequences and are fully allowed to continue radicalisating the left.\n",
      "13. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t“Massive corporate support”  You do realise that conservatives are still uncensored on social media right? Only the extremists who incite violence have been banned because companies don’t want to associate their brand with people who actively try to encourage the harassment and murder of people they don’t like.  You keep throwing this unhinged claim about but if we look at left wing rhetoric vs right wing rhetoric we have some stupid views that are a “treat them like they treat us” reaction to the right vs people who call for the murder of anyone they don’t like including sending death threats en made. These same (latter) people believe, while their party is in full control of the government, that a secret government is trying to control them. A secret government it should be mentioned that somehow couldn’t get anything done while they had power but somehow can do everything when they don’t.  The right wing propaganda machine exists purely to keep you angry, outraged and misinformed so that you’ll go after the enemies of the establishment with zero care to the consequences or to the fact that you’re going after people who try to make life better for the majority of society just to support people who want to only make the lives of the powerful few better.  The truth is, there may be some unhinged people on the left but the majority of the right are frothing at the mouth, schizophrenic levels of unhinged.\n",
      "14. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeft lost me when they went with the PC bullshit simple as that. i practice something called MAD i know i will get fucked over as well but its better alternative that me getting fucked and them getting all they want, Give me reason not to press that button.\n",
      "15. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease read all of this;  So you see destroying everything better than changing the things you don't like? Most of the left don't agree with the PC bullshit. Hell Scotland (where I'm from) is a hugely left wing country but PC culture is also largely ridiculous to most of us. Our favourite comedian is Frankie Boyle (a major left winger), a man who, when given a TV show, decided to make it the most offensive thing ever just to push the limits of PC culture.  We don't hear some middle class retard bang on about how we need to ALWAYS be PC and think \"Oh that sounds right\" we collectively say \"oh fuck off and grow up\" which is why a LOT of left wingers were pissed off when that guy got charged for making his dog do a Nazi salute but that was an English, conservative-made law he was charged under.  We view offence to words as being the most ridiculous thing ever, probably because we're the butt of a LOT of country's jokes so if we were to get outraged at words we'd be permanently outraged and we're pretty much born angry so we'd be apoplectic at everything.  The thing is though, right wing sources won't show you that. They'll show you some other dickhead with the minority opinion that PC is absolute, and they'll frame it as \"the left are against free speech\" which is patently ridiculous.  I have this conversation a lot with people where they say \"I'm becoming a lot more right wing because...\" and then they go on to list the same things as you, the voice of a retard with a minority opinion who grew up in middle class neighbourhoods where everyone was super nice to each other and afraid to say the wrong thing lest they insult the easily insulted dickhead at the end of the street.  You need to take a break from right wing sources and go speak to actual left wing people, research policy and understand that, just like when the media tells the left that Nazis are everywhere, right wing media is telling you that your worst fears are also everywhere, when they're not.  &#x200B;  Learn to think for yourself, and soon you'll see that by a factor of about 90%, left wingers and right wingers are no different in mentality. We're only separated by media influence that aims to keep us divided so the powerful elite (the rich) can do whatever the fuck they want to us and we'll be so busy fighting each other that we'll let them do it.  &#x200B;  ...well...you'll let them do it, because the left is the only ones standing up to the elites while the right continue to support absolute corporate freedom that hurts us all.\n",
      "16. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeft Wing fringe got support of Google etc  Right wing fringe gets attacked even by right wing,  The sad thing is that if what you are saying were true with you being majority etc  i would gladly help but unfortunately i think you are overstating your power, sadly. What you are saying has logic and the corporate support for what some call SJW fits what you are saying, i just have doubts that the sane left is as big as you think. We are mostly betting that third way has no love for todays elites.\n",
      "17. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOk well here's some common ground. I don't hear the attacks on the extreme right by the right, similarly I don't think you hear the attacks on the extreme left by the left. Would I be right?  Apparently places like twitter and facebook have algorithms that will make sure that left wing people will only see left wing views and right wing people will only see right wing views. Algorithms that go beyond simply what you like but towards what you click on.  We see this with youtube, you click on one daft video then suddenly you're bombarded with similar daft videos. It's not an agenda to keep us in echo chambers but rather an agenda to keep us coming back for the content that pleases us.  I would doubt that the sane right is in any way a majority but I argue FOR and against conservativism and liberalism so I see both sides of the coin so I know that we're all being played. The insane minority has a more vocal voice than the rational majority because the rational majority are just getting on with shit, life, work, bills etc.   We have these surface level arguments over everything but when we get down to the nitty gritty, we both know that the powerful elites ( who have no real ideology other than power and money) are the real problems but its easier to fight Joe dickhead with his dickhead comments than it is to fight big business with their wealth and power.   Simply accepting that things aren't as black and white as they appear is a massive step towards recognising that me and you, the average right and left winger, can do more together than we'll ever achieve as enemies. Even if, fundamentally we disagree on the best way to go about things, if we see each other as common citizens we'll find compromise in the middle that will give us both what we want (with concessions) without compromising our freedom to each other. \n",
      "18. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYeah you would be right, might be part of game, stop right from seeing left policing its nutcases and vice versa for left. Well see how this all ends, Hopefully  sane people can give both fringes and elites middle finger and pox on both your houses, not sure it will work but worth as shoot.\n",
      "19. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbsolutely. It all starts by seeing each other again as not fringe lunatics but compatriots with differing opinions.

The future of tomorrow begins with the work of today.\n",

Under that is a commentary of Societal responsibility and how important it is. It's for that reason it's still recommended in west point /USMC reading lists.  At the time it was criticized cause it featured an all-volunteer military with illegal conscription. It could just be a catchy tagline the publisher made.

Well it's cool if you think of it that way. But if still the order wank sits wrongly with me. Orders are orders and should be followed, but there's still a time when even a dumb jarhead should tell their superiors they're being retarded.  Personally I prefer letting recruits watch *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World* instead. That one's for all ranks (unlike what the title says), speaks of a soldier's duty, and no bullshit.\n",

Seeing how a major issue of a lot of modern liberal democracies is the fact that quite a sizable chunk of the voting population has no weight in the game other than getting benefits, this wouldn't be that bad of an idea.\n",

For a guy like me its pretty much a perfect system but its a might too morally idealistic. In some ways i think its hated so much. not so much as perceived fascism but cause of how *perfectly* it runs as far as governments go.\n",

They would say by just stating that they used to be guys, you're denying their right to exist or be validated.   And for gay people, if you like guys, suddenly you now have to also accept women that have transformed to become man-like.  Women have to share locker rooms with dicks, something that, right or wrong, we've tried to prevent.  My point being that \"allowing people to choose what they want\" often actually reduces the freedom of other groups. If a chick with a dick walks into a womens locker room where children and moms are present, and the vast majority feel uncomfortable with it, whos freedom do you prioritize? The minority that wanted to be in the girls locker room or the majority of women that felt uncomfortable with it?\n",

      "Row 1411, Column 'text' has multiple consecutive spaces: '1. I disagree with a fundamental premise of this article. The author seems to be under the impression that because gaming journalism is inherently shallow, it attracts people who are essentially well-meaning schlubs with no talent. He doesn't stop to consider that the quality may be shit because it's filled with people who are *malicious*; people who aren't just doing this because they like talking about stuff, but people who fucking hate the thing they cover and want to destroy it.  And I'm not sure why he thinks this. Is it because gaming publications are inherently aimed at hobbyists and would thus preclude any advancement into serious fields? If so, he should stop to consider that it isn't 2005; video games are not some thing you do in a basement somewhere. They're a multi-billion dollar industry and so the defense a small hobby has against social climbers is virtually gone. And that's not mentioning how becoming popular within a niche is a well known tactic; it's how the Paul brothers got rich, and Cardi B, and virtually every \"sensation\" since Justin Bieber. Why wouldn't opportunists be lurking around? Why *wouldn't* an industry bigger than movies have people willing to tank their own reputations to destroy it?  More to the point, it *is* possible to produce quality content we could describe as \"gaming journalism\". Yeah, rehashing press releases is stupid and non-productive, but there are people who conduct interviews with developers, mess around with hardware, report on the society and culture surrounding games, (in ways that aren't just polemics against consumers) conduct serious reviews of titles, etc, etc.  So I don't think \"game journalism sucks because it's just not possible for it not to suck\" is at all a valid stance to take; it's lazy and ignores the fact that gaming publications hire people who fucking hate video games. This naive view of games journalism still being issues of *Nintendo Power* and shit like \"Ctrl+Alt+Del\" is just flat-out wrong. If this guy was a political consultant, he'd be giving advice to candidates in 2018 on how to beat Dick Nixon, appeal to the Confederate war veterans in Georgia, and stick it to the USSR.\n",

Creating good videogame journalism might be as easy as figuring out how to publish it somewhere other than a Leftist urban enclave on the coast.\n",

      "15. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tI surely believe it's more needed there, but that doesnt mean that there arent quirks left that needs fine tuning in the west.   Take the wage gap for instance. First of all, the whole 77% of what a man makes is across jobs, not for the same jobs, so it doesnt necessarily prove that women are treated unfairly. But it does highlight some conservative values that still linger that that limits peoples choices through norms if not by rules. You could perhaps say that reducing the wage gap is a mens issue. Cause why do we have such a gap? We put a lot of expectations on women, but being able to earn a lot is not what we expect, so they might feel more free to pursue their passions even if it doesnt provide as much revenue, and take a workload that suits them better. Men on the other hand are considered more imporant, and are seen as more attractive, if they have money and power. So men put passions and personal well-being aside because we have to make money.   Another thing that is important to remember is that we cant expect things to stay the way they are, even here in the west. Right wingers dont want women to have access to abortions or for kids to get sexual education(which makes the girls end up pregnant) and thinks marital rape is okay. And the alt right movement has been growing a lot the last few years and is still growing. Racists and bigots are always at work, and financial interests in politics will always need a social struggle that they can use to trojan in their own politics, so the extremists on both sides will always get funding.  They're pitting them up against each other, trying to create polarized enemies, and in my oppinion you're falling for that tactic. This is a threath to the basic rights we take for granted, some of which we've had for decades already and are by no means considered progressive anymore. \n",
      "16. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t> I surely believe it's more needed there, but that doesnt mean that there arent quirks left that needs fine tuning in the west.  Not in socialist Sweden. Here, when we change something, it's done through violence and fascism. Things I don't believe in. I don't need a suppressive government to change our way of life. That's never going to get us to a good place.     > Take the wage gap for instance.    I don't believe it's a issue in Sweden. It's frankly, not even real if you're doing a multi-varied analysis of the proposed issue. Women tend to pick lower paid jobs, and that's despite boys being prohibited from taking internships in fields outside of healthcare, and girls being forced to take internships at engineering fields. That's the sort of anti-individualistic fascism and social constructive ideas I don't want in a free country. And ashamed of what feminism did to this country. And the fact that every counter-argument whenever feminism is under criticism is \"you don't understand the issue\" in public forums here, is fucking damning.    > But it does highlight some conservative values that still linger that that limits peoples choices through norms if not by rules.  Yes, but to pretend conservative values only apply to gender differences is benign at best, idiotic at worst. The same conservative values is also why we respect religion despite it being a bunch of nonsense and why it's illegal to smoke weed, while 20 nicotine cigarettes and a bottle of vodka a day is acceptable as long as you come sober to work.    I'm not saying there aren't bad conservatives values, but I'm saying that there's a lot of complex issues we have to fight, and I believe fighting them as a libertarian for freedom, is way better, than fighting gender questions separately by using the governments to point sticks.   > Cause why do we have such a gap?   Why do people choose different jobs? I do know, that there's way bigger gaps between rich and poor people, than there are between poor women, and poor men, as well as rich women and rich men. (talking about earnings here, specifically).   But overall, I think it's a complex issue, and I've never heard any feminist ever state they need to think about it and do a proper analysis and reach a conclusion, the Swedish feminist, left, environmental and socialdemocratic party is convinced that there exists a systematic problem, which they can solve if given enough power. That's not fighting for equality, that's pretending communism works and ignoring the dangers of trying to change the world.     > We put a lot of expectations on women, but being able to earn a lot is not what we expect   Since when is expectations bad? And who are we? I don't like being spoken for, and I'd say men in general need to be held under higher expectations, not that women should be feeling less expectations. But overall, I'd say, it's a liberal issue, everyone should be held at the expectations that they can reasonable be able to manage, as individuals.    > Right wingers dont want women to have access to abortions or for kids to get sexual education(which makes the girls end up pregnant)   Wrong, you're asserting American-centric politics here. Right-wings and left-wingers doesn't mean the same thing to us. Here in Sweden, even the Swedish Democratic Party (the nationalists) who want to ban all immigrants and throw them out, are pro-abortion. Literally 95% of Sweden is pro-abortion, it's **never** been a question here about yes or no. It's been \"how late?\" from the very start, we're a extremely non-religious country, even our \"Christian democratic party\" isn't anti-abortion.    See how different cultures can be even in the west? I assume you didn't know that, which is fine, Sweden is a very small country, but I think it's dangerous to look at conservative views and assume they're dangerous or good, because they're different from where you're standing. We have conservative views in Sweden I question heavily which nobody can defend, simply because we don't even talk about conservative values, we just stay quiet about subjects that falls under that term. Drug use for example. It's just not discussed anywhere. And whenever it is discussed, it's whataboutism, in it's worst way. But you can't claim right-wingers want a certain thing because that's just not true in the west.    The only ones who are fighting for things like anti-abortion laws are Islamists. And it's lefties politicians who let those into our political system. I'm not against immigration, but I am heavily against segregation that leads to poor integration into society. We have huge subgroups in Sweden who never learn Swedish, we have people following religious conservative values and practices which are illegal here, and our socialist government isn't doing anything because of how afraid everyone is to be branded as a bigot or racist for calling out shitty ideas and behavior.    edit: I'd love to keep the discussion going, but I'm heading home for work now, have a great day! \n",

See that's your problem. You aren't thinking. Women are chameleons and only mimic what you like to keep you interested in them. If you don't believe me browse any Facebook or social media site to see women in their true form.  >People whose only reference are social media and youtube usually don't really have much to say, regardless of their gender.

They are not required in life to succeed.   I have a WWII French Army rifle for sale. It's never been fired and dropped once. Are you interested?  Do you know why Paris has tree lined streets? Because even the Germans like to walk in the shade. Muslims also love to sleep under them and leave their trash behind.  Do you know why Vichy France supported Nazi Germany? Because all the women were fucking the SS due to their skull emblazoned black and silver uniforms.  Did you hear about the new French tank? It has 6 reverse gears and 1 forward. The forward gear is there in case the Germans manage to flank to the rear.  I heard that the Michelin Guide has classified France as a third world shithole. Is it true?\n",

You guys have a school shooting every months :)  Only if you aggregate the largest cities with the strictest gun laws with the rest of the country. The highest murders happen in the cities with the strictest gun control. Meanwhile in Plano, Texas where guns per capita is about 15 guns for every person they have a per capita murder rate of .02 per 1,000 residents. [Link](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/tx/plano/crime)  Now overall, with all of the US taken in aggregate the violent crime rate for murders is 5.3 per 100,000. It's not a lot actually since the US has over 350 million people.   Schools are gun free zones, so they are a soft target. Besides guns aren't the problem. It's the mental health system that is the problem and those people that commit those horrific shootings are criminals while also being mentally ill.   However, many schools now have been hardened with teachers and staff being armed using concealed carry.   >Also, there were indeed women that fucked germans, not because they had cool cloths but rather because it would provide them food and security.   You left out selling out their Jewish neighbors to be sent to the death camps.   >About French peopel surrendering, i could argue that we won more wars than americans (don't believe me, look it up).  I see that France has only won 13 wars with the majority of them were when they were in an alliance with other countries. The US hasn't lost a war yet. Vietnam was a win due to the treaty conditions when the US withdrew. Korea and Afghanistan are still ongoing. The US has been involved in far less wars overall so their record is 12 wins and 1 tie (War of 1812) with two still going on. France has an abysmal record and is only free because of the British and US fighting to keep them free from Germany in both WWI and WWII.   > At this point i think i have a pretty good insight of what kind a man you are. Uneducated redneck that probaly doesn't know shit about anything not related to your own country, probably with a pick up truc and a confederate flag on the back.  Funny, but I'm actually quite educated and it's nice of you to use a racial slur against me. Redneck is a term originated as a slur against white slaves by black slaves due to the sunburns white slaves received for working the fields. My family also originated as white slaves sent to Virginia in the 1670s. I've studied history for 35 years with a focus on American history and church history. I use primary source documentation to form my conclusions. My ancestors also include the first president of the United States George Washington.  My family fought in every single war since before the US was even founded and still colonies. In the War of Northern Aggression, I had kin on both sides fighting. My two great-great-great uncles, they were the two oldest children, fought with the Missouri Partisan Rangers in the Confederate Army due to the Union invading Missouri. Said Union Army rampaged throughout the state and ended up on my great-great-great-great grandmother's farm. They burned it to the ground then gang raped her. My great-great-great grandfather had a pistol put to his head by the colonel in charge of the regiment and was told to make a choice. He could serve in the Union Army or he could die where he stood. He was 16 at the time. His two oldest brothers took part in The Payback on the Union Army's killing of Confederate soldier families and were tried as horse thieves. They weren't accorded prisoner of war status under the Articles of War and hung for their participation in the battle. My great-great-great grandfather told us to never honor his service because he was forced murder and pillage fellow Missourians in an unjust war. We were to honor his brothers' service.  Both of my grandfathers fought in WWII. One was in the 101st AB and the other flew with the 703d Bombardment Squadron as a waist gunner in a B-24 Liberator. His pilot was none other than Jimmy Stewart and successfully completed the 30 mission requirement. My grandfather was awarded a Bronze Star with V device and 5 stars. Each star represented every successful bombing campaign he was a part of.  My AB grandfather almost lost his foot in training for D-Day's jump and survived due to a crushed foot. He didn't see combat as he spent the rest of his time in the service going from hospital to hospital fighting for his life.  As you can see I know more about history then you ever will. You can be ignorant towards me, but remember that my family and their buddies fought to free France twice. I didn't mention my great-great grandfather that served in WWI in the US Navy on the USS Rochester as the chief water tender either.  Now let me tell you about my father. He served in Vietnam from 1966-1967 in a war that France started. He was drafted and ordered to kill men, women, and children or he and his buddies would be killed. I remember his flashbacks and him screaming for medivacs for the 63 men that died in the Mekong Delta out of a platoon of 66 men. All because France couldn't let go of their colonial possession. Do you know what the US government did to recognize his and his buddies service? Those that survived were spat on and made to be ashamed to have worn the uniform of the US military. They were denied VA benefits for the PTSD, Agent Orange, etc... For my dad's service all he got was a flag and a tombstone. He was denied full military honors because he wasn't awarded a bronze star. At the time of his death, the US government cut the military back so bad that they couldn't bury all of their veterans with full military honors. All because your country refused to let Vietnam be an independent nation.  I pity you and your kind that spit on the memories and the families of those that served, bled, and died for your freedom. When France needs help in the future from the problems of your own making I will be sure to rally support to not send aid. In fact, I will be arguing for the removal of all US service members from Europe and the return of all of our war dead. You aren't worth any more blood and bodies. Now kindly go fuck yourself.\n",

(the last shooting in the yoga salon was by an INcel a bit like you, ironic :) )  Actually, most of the shootings in the US are done by black men. Yes, 6% of the population is responsible for over 50% of all crime and over 60% of the homicides. All done in nice gun controlled locations like Chicago and New York City.  I'm not Incel. I'm voluntary celibate. There is a difference.  >I counted 44 ever since revolution (around same time as creation of USA) About the war not being \"1v1\", most wars aren't, including wars involving the US.  You are including wars that France was in an alliance with other nations who actually won the wars. I counted only the wars that France was the only participant.  >Please, everyone knows US didn't win vietnam, it shacked you so deeply as a nation cause it was your first military loss.  No, the US didn't lose Vietnam. All US military personnel were pulled out in 1972. South Vietnam didn't collapse until 1975. Math do you know it? As I said we won the war as the treaty specifies it.  >Can't really argue with that, it is true, germans were indeed better at war than us (We had kinda shitty military decisions made by our commanders.

After I fucked my back in that job, I left on the day, they threatened they wouldn't give me attestation, I told them to get fucked in not so nice words.

The article I've read, however, has - up to now - 14,101 comments: http://archive.fo/yovIU  And it's accurate. As for what the person in video objects to, it's these parts of the article:  > Page 14 of the document acknowledges that a few Silicon Valley tech giants now “control the majority of our conversations,” but that these platforms – including Google – must now break their initial promise to users of free speech and content neutrality.  And this:  > Google, argues the briefing, must move towards the European tradition and create “well-ordered spaces for safety and civility” rather than “unmediated marketplaces of ideas.”  Personally, I'd first contact the person that wrote it. But, that's just me. Since the same person wrote several other articles as well. In the other article - the one which I read - it notes it accurately:  > The briefing argues that Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are caught between two incompatible positions, the “unmediated marketplace of ideas” vs. “well-ordered spaces for safety and civility.”  > The first approach is described as a product of the “American tradition” which “prioritizes free speech for democracy, not civility.” The second is described as a product of the “European tradition,” which “favors dignity over liberty and civility over freedom.” The briefing claims that all tech platforms are now moving toward the European tradition.  \"Claims x is the case,\" obviously isn't the same as \"argues x should happen.\"  And:  > The briefing associates Google’s new role as the guarantor of “civility” with the categories of “editor” and “publisher.”  The only line I'm not sure would be this:  > For example, the briefing argues that tech companies will have to censor their platforms if they want to “expand globally.”  It does mention it once or twice, but I'm not sure I'd say \"argues.\" For example:  > “US-based IT monopolies are already tempted to compromise themselves in order to gain entrance to these vast and fast growing markets. The dictatorial leaders in these countries may be only too happy to collaborate with them since they want to improve their methods of control over their own populations and expand their power and influence in the United States and the rest of the world.”  Another thing he objects to is \"Google admits.\" I can see how it might be misleading, however I'd say it depends on whether or not the \"Insights Lab\" is from outside Google, which as another user notes it doesn't seem to be the case. If it is, then yeah, it's misleading. If not - and it might not be, because as the other user says there's the link that goes back to Google, and they do say it's \"internal research,\" then it's not necessarily misleading. Here's what Breitbart said on it in a recent article:  > Perhaps they buy Google’s explanation that the presentation was just “research” and doesn’t reflect “official Google positions” — a  confusing explanation, as the research is about official Google positions. Is Google disagreeing with its own researchers’ assessment of where the company is headed?  I'd have still suggested contacting the author of the article first, but eh.  Also this: https://reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/9ohskg/journalism_ethics_do_not_be_fooled_by_the_recent/e7uahed/\n",

My question is, what evidence do you have that this is *not* a third party contractor?  >There's too much retardation to go through or try to listen to some YouTuber trying to seem smart. Maybe leave the work to actual journalists.  LAMO  No.   Your average YouTuber has better journalistic standards and due diligence than some of the most well payed journalists on earth. I'm including Logan Paul in that calculation.  I'd rather leave journalistic work to random animals and plants that I find, before I leave it to a journalist. At least I can expect a fair and non-deceptive result.\n",

      "4. \t\t\tSweet Jeebus, there's one in every crowd. My comment was facetious. If she had walked away, and he had stabbed her in the back and collapsed her lung, calling 911 and staying with her wouldn't save him. Being young and taking anger management classes wouldn't keep the cunt of a judge from locking him up for ten years or more. She doesn't even go to real jail; it's more like being grounded for forty weekends.  He's probably lucky that his collapsed lung made it impossible to speak. If some bitch stabbed me in the back, then called 911 and stayed with me, it would be so difficult to not say something that would piss her off, and cause her to stab me again. Better to stay mute and gasping for every breath.\n",

The dipshit who was elected based on his fun, alcoholic hllbilly brother who pissed on runways and shit.   Then you really went for it. You elected an actor who's greatest accomplishment was authorizing the national guard to shoot protesting hippies. Then some random retard, but you were'n't done there.   Your next sex-offender of a president, who'd raped multiple women decided to personally preside over the execution of a literal retard to hype his \"tough-on-crime\" stance to the whites while playing the sax on Arsenio to appeal to the blacks. He got his dick sucked by interns in the Oval office.   Then you went with George Bush's monkey son, who also kicked off his campaign by presiding over the execution of a retard. He started expensive wars for no reason, without ever actually punishing Saudi Arabia for 9/11.   So then you went with hope and change. The black President. Who pretended to be about peace then bombed the shit out of everybody and introduced drones into war (what's the civilian casualty rate on those again.)   Fuck, you wouldn't even be deploying cancer rays at the border if your retard of a president hadn't fucked up Honduras in the first place for no goddamn reason.

Maybe a bit of low level math.  But fuck your future, you'll be a good union worker and support the CCCP.  If I was to go through high school again, I'd learn as much as I could online, which is all free, about anything that's actually useful, and run out the clock at school, since it is nothing of value.  I'm pretty sure, from your post, you know how to read and write and I'm guessing up to at least an algebra level of math.  If you aren't going into STEM, do you need to know more?  No, because everything else is stuff you'll need to answer questions on Bar Trivia Thursday.  I wouldn't drop out of school though.  Now if you want to be an entrepreneur, learn about business entities, how to budget, how to do some accounting, payroll laws in your area, municipal and states codes and regulations, go down town and find out how to apply for a business license and what that means.   Learn principles of marketing, management, and accounting.  Even if all you're going to do is open a hot dog stand, which is a good first move  because it's cheap, simple, requires you to learn some regulation, and it's pretty much a break even operation.  Do some Uber of Lyft an run it like you're running a business, learn some budgeting, writing off expenses, do a balance sheet, figure out net profits, file some taxes, and all that fun.  Learn to do (if you're in the U.S.) your own 1040 for income taxes, even if you don't file them because your parents claim you.  Why?  Because schools don't teach a damn thing about how money works.  Because they want you nice and stupid and a good socialist.  \n",

STEM field subjects don't appeal to women at a base level, and don't appeal to the vast majority of the general public at that same base level. This is because they require a level of scholastic preparation and understanding that is far above what the average person desires to spend, to the point that people who enjoy them consistently showcase similar symptoms to high-functioning autism. There, I saved you half a mil; the NSF should've sent the check to me.  Seriously, the verdict on the 'Women in STEM' argument has been available for years now, and the bottom line is that STEM shit just doesn't appeal to the vast majority of people, including the vast majority of women. It's hours upon hours of memorizing formulas and rote material, constant testing to ensure knowledge retention, and repetition ad infinitum. Yeah, anyone can go into STEM and learn it, but as someone part of it, while I would like to see more of anyone in the club, the journey fucking sucks. If you want more people in STEM, the education methodology needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, starting with Mathematics as it's the ultimate framework for the rest of the group, and then moving on from there. Good luck, however, getting old hats to change what clearly works in favor of appeasing the up-and-comers who tend to be self-centered and lazy.  >The study seeks to upend current engineering and computer science programs by educating students and faculty on the \"benefits of diversity and transformations required to foster welcoming environments for women.\"  Then this is not a study. A study collects and analyzes data, that's it. It isn't designed to push changes on its own; such action is supposed to be for those who wish to interpret the data that way. It's almost like this anthropologist is barely a legitimate professor and has no idea what her job is supposed to be (hint: it's not forcing personal ideologies on others for the sake of being able to give yourself a back-pat).  >Due to the prominence and impact of ECS [engineering and computer science], identifying gender inequities in the field and interrupting them will help welcome and retain more talented women from a range of intersectional identities  The assumption that all women are talented, because that is what is being implied here, is beyond retarded and speaks to the general societal sentiment that too many people have been coddled into thinking they are worthwhile/matter. This just in: you don't. Nobody matters until they make the personal decision to leave behind some kind of legacy. Such a thing is not a 'given', it's an 'earned', and had these people had parents who pushed them to compete via some means, they would've learned this.  >\"intersecting vectors of gender.\"  What an unintentionally hilarious statement. Not only does this just sound ridiculous when you read it, because it's obviously the result of a stupid person using big words to sound intelligent, but anyone who has a decent vocabulary knows that the term 'vector' relates to pathogens and disease transmission, resulting in a statement that rounds down to 'intersecting diseases of gender'.  >If anything, at least they aren't giving a lot of money for someone to study microagressions, so... that's an improvement I guess?  Perhaps, but the organization is still pissing away over half a million dollary-doos that's going to result in a highly-biased result that is woefully inadequate, confusing to parse, and rushed. What would have been a better expenditure would've been to host some sort of scholarship contest for kids entering into college involving some important-yet-lower-tier research project, where said students would have to produce a finalized report and analysis (properly supervised, of course). That way, you immediately separate the wheat from the chaff and find out not only who wants to go to college for STEM, but you also give young kids an exposure to real academic work to see if they want to actual make a career out of studying and testing. This gives them a chance to test the waters, rather than forcing them to make the decision in the middle of their transition and far more difficult undergraduate course work or, god forbid, at the start of their graduate course work because the college they went to didn't have enough funding to start proper academic research projects for undergrads.  Or, shit, just donate it to an up-and-coming school/department, or buy a bunch of supplies and auction them off to programs that need them. Fuck, anything would be better than giving money that belongs to the sciences to a fucking humanities professor that unironically teaches shit like 'Queer Anthropology', as if the ancient human races spent any time coming up with statements like, 'Hmm, I woke up on the left side of the bed today, so I guess I'm a demi-gender pan-deersexual wolf-half-human who has a penis, but that's hidden inside me and manifests itself via a vagina'.\n",

It's American women that drown.   That means it's a cultural problem and it's a cultural problem with American women.\n",
      "4. \t\tSTEM is actually nearly at parity.  Mathematics, last I checked, is at 40% women.  The sciences vary -- I believe biology is majority women, chemistry is near parity, and physics is still male-dominated.  So it's basically technology and engineering that are majority women.  You do see a lot of Indian women in tech, but you see a LOT more Indian men.  I think women are even scarcer in most of the engineering subfields. \n",

The left is reeling.  The left in America has a near religious worldview.  Everyone agrees with them.  They're so, soooo smart.  The smartest ever.  They're the party of good ideas and civil rights and that means that they have a monopoly on those issues.  And that means that everyone not them is the exact opposite -- Stoooooopid rednecks who hate everyone and will never amount to anything.  The US is fundamentally liberal and thanks to Obama, we've entered a liberal golden age and the GOP will have to spend the next 30 years out in the wilderness until they learn how to be DNC-lite....   Wait, what do you mean she lost?  Wait, it's Trump?  And he's doing a good job?  *And half the country agrees with him?*  That doesn't make any sense!  There MUST be something wrong with the country and reality itself, because lefties *can't be wrong.*    2. At the same time you have them having this mental breakdown due to the world refusing to confirm to their fantasies... You have their reaction being organized protest.  Heavily organized protest, to the point of being basically glorified mob actions.  And the way the left does this stuff is they synchronize the protests.  Very effective... but it makes it hard to ignore the fact that you're all synchronizing things.   Remember when we called them Snowflakes and they got pissed?  It touches on an unspoken assumption.  The lefties might all have the same beliefs and might all say the same things and might all be wearing the same pussy hats and might all be carrying the same professionally printed signs, but *they are all unique individuals* who happened to come upon these exact same ideas/phrases/talking points/etc because **they're just that smart.**   The NPC meme points out that, well, they're not getting all those ideas from their own galaxy sized brains.  They're getting them from, well, indirectly from Soros mostly, but from alpha lefties who hand them out.  The Rachel Maddows and the ShareBlues and the Media Matters of the world.  And on some level... they know this.  And it makes them feel really, REALLY uneasy.    3. Finally, you have the fact that the NPC meme is people mocking the left.  *Mocking.*  **The left.**  The left, which is comprised of the best of humanity.  The left, who are smarter than everyone else.  The left, who have the most perfect golden morality and ethics and beliefs.  ***How DARE you!?***   And yet... everyone is.  So, a perfect storm - poking several deep seated insecurites the left has, all while laughing at those insecurities and their reaction to it all.  Small wonder they're losing their shit.\n",

      "7. \t\t\t\t....I mean... I find your blind trust in our failing education system more concerning than a 17 year olds willingness to skip school. I like how someone skipping school at 17 affects their ability to 'take the helm of society' at 27, as if there is absolutely no maturing that occurs between 17 and 27. They are making the mistakes that teach hard lessons through experience. This is the most jaded bitch fest I've seen in a while. Like either of our generations were any better...\n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\tI don't think the Americwn school system is good at all. This singular day of skipping school is part of a larger issue of plain apathy at high schools and colleges; i.e. many people just don't care.  We have yet to see how today's people grow up to be, I'm alongside them and it's going to be interesting to see if the \"past is just as bad as today\" argument stands.,  The previous generations had plenty of drugs and sex as well, but they did some useful things like revolutions and changed the world. Even the ones who dropped out gave us things like Apple and Microsoft and whatever, funnily.\n",
      "9. \t\t\t\t\t\tI mean you see apathy, but I see rebellion. I think it should just be an accepted fact that most of humanity are apethetic pieces of shit, regardless of generation. I mean we got Microsoft and Apple in the 70's/80's, Google and the internet in the 90's Facebook and Android (android was it's own start up before Google bought them) in the 00's, Uber/Lyft in the 10's and we're moving towards machine learning and self driving cars in the next decade, there is no shortage of innovation, but it's all being done by a minority of the population, as it always has been. I think that rebellious spirit that questions 'why are we going to school?' 'what do we get out of this?' 'how can this be easier?' is a misguided version of the same sentiment that spurs innovation. Engineers are generally lazy, and their innovations are solutions to the question 'how can we do more with less?'. Behind a senior skip day, I see an individual that questioned 'why do we go to school everyday? Why are we wasting all of this effort? If we organize, how can they punish us all?' and acts on those questions by organizing the senior skip day. Do I think that is a good idea? No, but that misguided endeavor was undertaken because of that individual's lack of wisdom. If that individual continues to make mistakes, learns from them and refines their actions to reflect that wisdom gained, but keeps the rebellious spirit to go against the status quo and question everything, I would put my money on that individual to go out and actually make a difference. And sure in that scenario there was a whole mess of people that mindlessly followed someone just so that they didn't have to go to school, but those are just the people that will end up working for the companies that initiating individual will eventually create.\n",

And one of the thundercunts started laughing, and saying something along the lines of \"Imagine how funny it would have looked, just flopping around in the garbage disposal!\" and all of them except I think one were laughing, and that one chick had this \"This is wrong...isn't it?\" look on her face. I mean...Jesus!   Reverse the genders. Man snuck up on a sleeping woman, hacked off a piece of her anatomy, and tossed it into garbage disposal. A bunch of men on TV hear about it, and start laughing about how funny it looks, flopping around in there. Can you guys honestly see this kind of shit on daytime television?

Lara had been a huge cunt before. A dangerously charming femme fatale, but still an asshole with a personal agenda. She's not a \"hero\" in the noble sense, she's sassy, selfish and *literally a tomb raider*. It's the 2013 reboot that actively tried to make a cookie cutter \"role model\" out of her, also doubling down on family values after LAU.  I would say that (Classic) Lara was the \"fascinating\" kind of bad girl. Think Ocean's Eleven.

They've had such a stranglehold on the entire distribution of media business and now they're deathly afraid of missing out on the next generation because they're old and stupid, so as a result there's folks working on their behalf in the upper parts of YouTube to try to keep them relevant.

I don't trust them because I don't know their motivations beyond some vague notion of progressivism which really just looks like a mask to cover this fucking corportist controlled tyranny.

Watch Louis Le Vau's video on this.  Well - listen to it since it's more of a ramble:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKhVVhiratM  The conservative argument against loli is always the Miller case, but there are counterpoints for that argument - it is a big legal gray area in the US (where gab is located), which is why it's still a tough position to defend either way - on principle your default position is that you HAVE to defend it even if it's a grey area, because otherwise you are not being principled in your approach.  Free speech is a zero sum game - it's easy to defend what you agree with, but it's hard to defend what you find despicable.  Loli hits that moral spot for a lot of people who aren't familiar with otaku culture.  Right now a lot of the \"pro free speech\" sentiment aren't just coming from us middle of the road leftist/centrist types, but from a lot of traditional conservative evangelical types.  Compared to the left, conservatives are VERY sensitive about any depiction of children being harmed whereas the regressive left cares more about WAMEN and minorities being harmed.  So the depiction of loli in anime really bugs a lot of normie types, especially the normie conservative folks who are completely unaware of anime or the meme culture that is centered around it.  Unfortunately, KiA *has* to follow Reddit's authoritarian rules to exist.  The mods think in the long run it's beneficial for this sub to exist as a kind of refuge sub for moderates who got burned by the regressives in the other sub.  We're just trying to avoid getting lined up to the wall by a wayward Reddit admin and shot for wrongthink.  However, Gab has touted itself as a strict pro free speech platform since its inception.  That was the hill they claimed they will die on, but once again because the founder is conservative, their ideology (feelings) gets in the way of their principles (facts) and he ends up going after his own userbase for it.  If he JUST stuck to \"we need to keep the lights on.  I don't want to do it either, but we need to be able to survive\" then people MIGHT be more apologetic, but his platform is also at the mercy of all its providers and I bet you a bunch of them will not hesitate to drop them because of how charged and retarded our modern political climate has become.  So for him to snap back at his userbase by using all the ignorant normie talking points regarding loli to insult them is pretty hypocritical of him.\n",
      "18. \t\t\t\tLouis Le Vau is awesome. I was impressed by his response to Sargon (and I can't wait to see what Sargon says in reply). The point that struck me was that one can't prosecute over Loli because there is no target for whom you must seek justice. That's a profound position from which to start.\n",

OTOH, by arresting and prosecuting the (American, collegiate, usually white) street-level thugs of the Black Bloc, we can enact a bit of a \"broken windows\" policy against these scumbags before they succeed in spreading their message. It occurs to me that the target of an antifa attack is almost *never* the real target. The real target is the rest of the country. They're slowly teaching us: *don't fucking speak out or we'll come after you and your family* and it's not just the Tuckers of the world who get targeted. Tucker has resources and support. But when *I* get targeted, or you do, what do we do? Batten down the hatches, okay.

      "Row 1631, Column 'text' has multiple consecutive spaces: '1. So just to be clear:   About 10 million men and teenaged boys died fighting in WW1.    The majority of these men didn't have the right to vote, because suffrage in Europe was contingent on property ownership, and most working class men didn't own enough property to be enfranchised.    The mountains upon mountains of straight white male corpses propelled the universal suffrage movement to the forefront.    Women achieved the vote upon mountains of dead males, both in Europe and the US (see: civil war).   Not a single woman had to actually fight for suffrage.  She suffered no real risk.  She just had to complain to the men in power.   And the \"patriarchs\" in government gave women the vote with no conscription obligations (that's not equality, that's chivalry) as soon as the majority said they wanted it.    These men and boys, who suffered some of the worst deaths humanly imaginable -- having their guts blown out in trenches and inhaling poison gas, being eaten alive by rats while crucified on barbed wire -- were \"privileged\", according to feminists.     A sizable percentage of feminists from the time period actually encouraged men and boys -- who again couldn't vote -- to go die for them in the trenches, to protect female \"honor\" (see white feather campaign).    While the suffragists demanded universal suffrage, the suffragettes wanted only rich white women and men to vote.   We celebrate the latter, not the former, because the former draw into question feminist mythology  [Edit: there were some women from the time period, often described as feminists or proto-feminists, who were consistent; eg the American anarchist Emma Goldman (whom I'm quite sure would be appalled by modern feminism) helped mount a legal challenge arguing that conscription was a violation of the 13th Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude.   The Supreme Court disagreed.   Ironically Goldman considered the suffragettes a bunch of spoiled brats, and famously claimed that \"if voting changed anything they'd make it illegal\"]    Hundreds if not thousands of men were executed on the front lines to prevent desertion, even though historians now agree that many WWI campaigns were useless suicide missions, that the men knew it, and that the \"deserters\" were in the right not to throw their lives away for a patch of mud.    In the US, men were imprisoned, tortured and even executed for refusing to fight.   These included conscientious objectors from religious groups.   (two of these men, Hutterite brothers, were tortured to death at Alcatraz).    The majority of American men who fought in WWI were effectively forced to do so.   Far more Americans who fought in WWI were conscripted than volunteered.    Today, little rich girls who would be living in the gutter without the benefaction of their rich daddies, and living in caves without the benefaction of men as a group, condemn powerless white men and boys from a hundred years ago who died being eaten alive by rats while crying out for their mothers -- because they were white, and male.     Yes, this is a perfectly sane society, and feminism is a perfectly sane philosophy.   Moreover it encourages \"gender equality.\"    Honestly, I don't feel hate.  I just feel shame and disgust.   Shame for what feminism has done to this society, and disgust for both the men and women who have allowed this to happen.    \n",

Any fantasy setting with magic in it was part of an evil plot to get children into wichcraft so they would summon demons and shit. It's hard to say what numbers they had at that kind of extreme though, since I only learned of stuff like that from people passing it around to mock them. The SJWs seem to have a lot more actual pull, but social media and technology may partly explain that.\n",

Especially when there are reasons people can think of off the top of their heads as to why the guy may have not just kicked her ass out the door.   Now, I am not one of the people who even brought up \"Hydrocephalus.\" What I said, in a made up quote, because I thought it would be kind of obvious that it was my supposition, that since she was (we all agree) guilty of criminal battery against him (article cites stab wounds and third degree burns) it would be a reasonable for him to assume \"if I go to sleep in a way this batshit insane bitch doesn't like, she's gonna stab me and burn me.\" Same goes for wearing clothes she didn't like, or literally anything else she told him to do.   And if you don't think that is reasonable, because 'he should have just stopped her' then any battery she committed against him would be excusable under the same reasoning, because 'he could have just stopped her.' Except he plainly couldn't stop the battery while he was awake, so doing it when he was asleep was probably not an option.   > Stockholm syndrome is a better explanation which is still just him being a cuck.

      "2. \tIt wasn’t a remake. It was appropriation of IP by a studio trying to cash in on on social trends.   Each individual in that pile of shit was an accomplished, competent filmmaker. Jello tastes great. Steak tasted great. You don’t put fucking strawberry jello on a steak. Just like you don’t take a bunch of people with a loose idea of funny and an agenda, then throw gobs of money at them.   Strong women should absolutely be in movies. Look at Ripley, the chick in Gone Girl, or Cersei Lannister. We know worthwhile, cool, interesting female characters exist. Fuck, we want more of them. We just don’t need studios pandering to a very small minority of screaming social media users-or we do and enjoy watching failure. \n",
      "3. \t\tThe chick in Gone Girl was a sociopathic manipulator who killed a man to hide her guilt. And then knocks herself up to entrap her husband in marriage. Not to mention faking her murder in the first place.  That's not strength.\n",
      "4. \t\t\tFuck here we go you’re confusing strength with righteousness and morality. Despite her sociopathic tendencies the character in that movie is at her very core a manipulator and a survivor she’s anything but weak and she’s most certainly strong \n",
      "5. \t\t\t\tBeing the strongest-willed sociopath in the room isn't something anyone should aspire to. Putting the GG villain on par with Ripley is an insult to Ripley.  When we hold up Ripley as a strong woman, it wasn't just because she survived, but that she tried to help people while doing it. If survival is the only thing that makes you a good, strong female character, all those women who survive to the end of horror movies are on equal footing with Ripley.   No one's huffing Ripley's strong woman farts because she survived.\n",
      "6. \t\t\t\t\tJesus dude you’re still confusing morality and your feelings with facts. They’re both strong characters ones a morally sound strong female protagonist and one is a morally bankrupt female antagonist but they are both strong female characters that people are allowed to like. There is absolutely nothing wrong with comparing her to Ripley they’re both well written strong female characters that people like just two sides of the same coin.\n",
      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\tTell me, if the main villain in Gone Girl had been the husband. And he  pinned the fake-murder on the ex-boyfriend. And then murdered the ex-boyfriend to clear himself of suspicion. And told the women she was pregnant and blackmailed her to stay in the marriage. Would he be a strong male character? A survivor... of being cheated on?  The answer is no. So either women get a pass for what's considered \"strong\" or the GG villain isn't as stronk as you think.  I'm not saying she wasn't a well-written character. I just don't think she was strong in any way we should hold up as worthwhile.\n",

Western RPGs like those from Bioware and Bethesda get away with selectable gender because their main characters are purposefully basic as player avatars with all of the personality gets put into other characters met along the way.

This is the original sentence:  >the statements made by the alleged victim and her friends when interviewed by police simply weren’t adding up.  Then when we break it up into two sentences:  >the statements made by the alleged victim when interviewed by police simply weren’t adding up.  and  >the statements made by her friends when interviewed by police simply weren’t adding up.  However, your argument is that it MUST be interpreted this way. That is not how grammar works.  In middle school we were taught that in order to simplify a sentence, you removed the prepositional phrases and treat the sentence as a simple verb/noun/direct object.  The sentence then reads as:  >the statements made weren’t adding up.  with the prepositional phrase:  >by the alleged victim and her friends  This is then diagrammed to show two objects of the preposition: VICTIM and FRIENDS  This means that if you read at an elementary school level, then the ghostofB interpretation can be the only one.

Being gay myself, this is why I've criticized the community's propensity to label every possible preference or presentation, it just confuses everyone and creates stupid and meaningless labels. Of course, this just got me called a bigot.   I've been told I'm \"gray-ace homoromantic\" because I'm not huge on sex but I'm only interested in romantic relationships with men. I've been told I'm \"demi-homosexual\" because I don't like doing one night stands and I like sex more for emotional reasons (feeling close to someone, feeling loved and love the feeling of caring for a man) than I do physical reasons. Been told I'm bisexual/sexually fluid because I think some heterosexual erotica is hot. I've been told I'm an \"otter\" because I'm hairy but am too slim to be a \"bear\". Been called a \"stone butch\" because I fall on the more masculine end of the spectrum, prefer to be the dominant partner, and love taking care of my boyfriends.   It's just stupid. Date who you like, wear whatever clothes you like, do your hair however you like, have or don't have sex, etc. Stop thinking every little thing needs a label. Also, kind of a side note, I just want to say how interesting it is how many of these people I see say \"not interested in cis straight men\". As far as I know, there's no inherent physical differences between straight, gay, or bisexual cis men, so it's clearly a political thing (trying to undermine cis straight guys), not an actual sexual preference. That's another issue, stop making your sexuality and gender expression a political thing.   \n",

Whatever happen to \"I have these bits and I want to put them in those bits\" or \"I have these bits and want those bits in me\"  &#x200B;  Hell, the word gender was never supposed to be what it is now. It was merely used as \"grammatical gender\" for masculine, feminine and neuter speech towards or used by a certain sex.  &#x200B;  It has since been bastardized (and massively diluted) that gender is a social construct.  &#x200B;  Ironically, according to a testament by  [David Haig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Haig), \"Among the reasons that working scientists have given me for choosing gender rather than sex in biological contexts are desires to signal sympathy with feminist goals, to use a more academic term, or to avoid the connotation of copulation.\" or more simply, they just didn't want to say the word 'sex' because it's icky.  &#x200B;  All of this has gone the way of the word 'moron'. If you all want a laugh look it up and how the word 'retarded' relates to it historically.   &#x200B;  TL;DR shit is needlessly complicated and I don't want to live on this planet anymore.\n",

I looked at the BioWare devs acting like fucking clowns and brushed it off. (Although, \"When you press a button, something something awesome has to happen. Button. Awesome. Connect.\" is permanently burned into the part of my brain that responds to cringe.) Still pumped.   Then I played it. I remember the exact moment I raised an eyebrow. It was in Kirkwalls lowdown at night, and I'd just dispatched a group of enemies. Then another one appeared out of nowhere. Then I turned the corner and the exact same thing happened.   These combat encounters littered the game. And it's not the good kind of combat encounter that's fun. It's the bad kind that's only there to make it difficult to walk from point A to point B and pad out the length of the game.   And speaking of padding out the length, there were so many fucking reused levels. It's really not funny. Like, no other game I can think of has such poor variety in levels.   But fuck it, I'll enjoy the story....  Oh wait, **there isn't one.**  And I don't mean \"The story is bad.\" I mean it doesn't fucking exist. It's just a series of disjointed events that somehow explode into a war and also that trinket you found in the deep roads was super important. Aren't you glad we told you nothing about it?   But... Well the original dragon age had a kind of disjointed story too, I suppose. I guess I'll enjoy the characters. Let's see...   You don't get points for keeping combining the best parts of Awakening. Because we've already played awakening.   Fenris is... No.   Isabella is... I gave her to the Arishok on every playthrough because if she's gonna cause a bunch of Chad's to invade a city because someone stole their nerd book she really is too dumb to live.  Merrill gave meaning to the phrase \"Burn it before it lays eggs.\" In my mind.   So no, Dragon Age 2 was BioWares worst showing to date in my mind. So I decided to check the reviews...  Boss, the reviews were glowing. All of them.  And I sat and thought about this for a while, how can something that came from a formula they'd knocked out of the park on the first try, then fucked it up so hard, be so well liked?  Then I saw all the ads running on the pages for the reviews. They were Dragon Age 2 ads.   Then I realised. \"Oh, these motherfuckers are bought and paid for.\"  Haven't taken their opinions seriously since. That makes it what, 7 or 8 years almost? \n",
      "2. \t> Isabella is... I gave her to the Arishok on every playthrough because if she's gonna cause a bunch of Chad's to invade a city because someone stole their nerd book she really is too dumb to live.  I saw it as the Equivalent of stealing the Bible from the Vatican or the Quran, she was literally too dumb to live, handed her to the Arishok (She prob would have Died from an STD anyway)  Merrill was just, not appealing to me, eh, whatever.  I hated Fenris whiny ass.  Anders betrayal was...actually cool, how he duped you into helping, i dont like his actions, but i enjoy the concept and character.  Varric is still bro tho\n",
      "3. \t\tAnders betrayal kind of relies on Hawke being an idiot.   \"What's that Anders... You want Arsenic, Thermite, a black trench coat, the home adress of all the popular kids at school an assault rifle... I see nothing suspicious here.\" - Hawke.   Dude literally asked for saltpetre, the shit you use to make gunpowder and then asked you to kindly distract the people he was going to blow up while he hid the bomb.   I clocked it immediately that this dude was up to something.\n",
      "4. \t\t\t> relies on Hawke being an idiot.  Sadly, extemely common to the Plot, a Serial killer targeting women? \"I better not tell my mom\"  Isabella (A known thief) not going anywhere near the Qunari and both arriving at the same time while they say they are looking for something \"Nope, nothing, they arent related at all\"  And many other examples\n",

Did the defendant intend to kill someone (murder), or was that a fight that went too far accidentally (manslaughter).    Did you run over a person with your car on purpose when you veered towards them, or were you just trying to scare them and lost control?   If you get charged, a jury has to decide.  Did you make a joke about someone slapping this guy, or did you intend to incite violence.  The police and crown prosecution need to decide what to charge you with, and a jury need to determine if you were guilty or not based on the charge and the evidence.  Law is not black and white. I, for one, think she had a clear culpability in this man's murder whether she knew it would lead to death, or just violence, is another thing (and she only got charged with encouraging violence, not murder) and as the law is written, she was rightfully charged.\n",

      "7. \t\t\t\t\t\tThere's no secret cabal or grand conspiracy.  However there is a divergence of values stemming from a Jewish tendency to resist fully assimilating into the nation states they live in.  There is a pattern through history of Jews existing as a nation within a nation.  It's actually incredible that the Jewish identity has survived over the millenias, but the survival of the Jewish identity is probably explained by the identity having the power of being a racial identity, cultural identity, and religious identity all rolled into one.  Because there is a lack of full assimilation Jews generally don't share the same loyalty to whatever the nation state they live in (the nation state is often a legitimate existential threat) and Jews are far more likely to embrace values that may be destructive to the nation state such as multiculturalism and globalism.  It's better to be a nation among nations than a nation within a nation.  Factor in extremely high Jewish IQ levels and Jews rise to the top of any industry that rewards intelligence.  As a result Jewish values are disproportionately reflected in the greater culture.\n",
      "8. \t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe jewposters complaining about Jews sound identical to BLM complaining about white people. They're more successful than you so they must be up to something, and they're a threat that must be stopped by force because they're too powerful to compete with.  It's all such fucking nonsense. Some jews are successful, deal with it, compete with them by working harder, not by freaking out all day on the internet, and inventing insane conspiracy theories that are so obviously retarded.   Looking at the government, and at the people I know, the jews are far from the only ones who are pushing globalism and multiculturalism. Is Justin Trudeau a jew? No, let me guess, he's mind controlled by the secret power jews and isn't responsible for his own retardation, as a result.   People can act out of the interests of their own country without a jewish conspiracy being a driving factor behind it. \n",

And why do you think JT embraces multiculturalism and globalism?  He's a vapid conformist.  A parrot who literally recites globalist slogans.  There's a reason the NPC meme has been so effective at stereotyping the left.  Because much of the left, Trudeau especially, are parrots and conformists.  It is totally irrational for a leader to celebrate the death of his own nation state by bragging about how his country is the first post national state, but it is rational for a historically oppressed minority who may feel vulnerable to the power of nation state to take comfort in such an outcome .  As I said, there's no conspiracy, just a *disproportionate influence*.  Conformists, the naive, morons, good little girls, and the emotionally manipulatable can be influenced to adopt values that are not in their best interests.

If they talk back to a cop, they think when they come out of the situation they will look \"cool\" and won't get made fun of.

Third, hating men is not only perfectly acceptable, it's practically *expected* for women to think \"Men are pigs.\" Men are dogs.\" \"All men cheat.\" I shouldn't even have to bring up the talk show segment when Sharon Osbourne, her co-hosts, and her audience were all laughing at a guy who had his penis cut off by his wife. All while Sharon rationalizes it.  I've never seen *any* public commentary where men laughed at the idea of a woman having her breasts cut off, or being violently vaginally sodomized, was considered hilarious and rationalized by men on television.   The closest I've ever heard to anything like that, was by a British infantry unit during the American Revolution reporting on a brutal small scale massacre that loyalist American militias had done to a family farm that supported the revolution.

Because they're the only party who is calling liberals out on their bullshit. If leftists started doing that more instead of just attacking the right, it would go a really long way toward recruitment. that's why i was ultimately disappointed with Bernie's campaign.

I've always likened it to a pendulum, the further it gets pulled in one direction, the swing to the other side is just as severe, then it'll calm down, and then it'll settle.  Then something will happen, it'll pull it back again, and set it off all over again.  It's amazing, the amount of times the people who I've seen say \"I was a part of the left, but then I was pushed away\", and the problem is, when they do leave, they get called \"Nazi\", \"Alt-Right\", \"Racist\", and all manner of things.  You ever see \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\"?  It's sort of like that part where John Cleese is the Frenchman and says \"Now, be gone, or I shall insult you one more time!\" it's like that \"Hey!  Don't be different from us... or we'll call you a Nazi!!\" it's not a threat, it no longer means anything, because that's all that's being presented it seems.  Hillary should have had a complete slam-dunk, literally should have been the easiest election ever, but (as someone who only ever saw what British TV shows us), it just seemed like all she provided was \"Hey, I'm Hillary Clinton, I'm a woman!  See, look, woman!  How about that?!  Woman as president!  Never seen a woman do this job before, vote for me, Hillary Clinton, woman!\"  I think, if Bernie ran, I don't think Trump would have won.\n",

That being said, I think there's a difference between selling locally and adhering to those local laws and selling country-wide both digitally and physically.

No, I was just saying in actual application of the law, a nationally-known entity with an easily looked up headquarters would be easier to go after than some small store that isn't breaking any local laws and is thus out of the jurisdiction of anyone that would care.  Though I supposed by that logic, these companies can be operating in areas where it's 100% legal and since there aren't any actual federal laws in place, anyone going after them would similarly be out of their jurisdiction, so the best they can do is go after consumers in 100% illegal areas.\n",

I imagine that there's a lot more prejudice in states, or at least communities, where there's a \"black culture\" well divided from the \"white culture\" of the state's majority, specially if \"both sides\" of the culture divide have enough numbers to be noticeable. Prejudice and bigotry don't get spontaneously generated in an instant, it's culturally built and reinforced by negative interactions with the side they are prejudiced against. Someone who never gets in contact with \"the other\" might end a bit prejudiced, but unless their culture really build said group as boogeymen, those prejudices and stereotypes likely won't last long after actual contact with people from that subgroup (that don't follow the prejudiced stereotype, of course). Might even be only at an individual level at first (\"one of the good ones\", so to speak), but even that already starts breaking down the bigotry.  &#x200B;  No, it's the places where there's an \"active conflict\" between the groups where the bigotry truly festers. It's where there's a defined \"black community\" that hates \"them whiteys\", and a \"white community\" that hate \"them niggers\" that bigotry truly gets to live.

I still can't find racist people, yet it's always on the tip of everyone's tongue waiting to call people out on it.   Just went to Virginia \"lynchville\" and while walking into a Wendy's to use the restroom a table of all white 80+ aged women stared down my gf (she's black) and start whispering to each other (I'm white if that matters). Meanwhile every other soul in there buying food was white, but every worker was black. The cashier saw us walk in and started laughing when they saw the reaction of the old ladies.   Now...

My issue is that it's written like absolute shite. It's peak telling-not-showing, and everything is spelled out like the writers are assuming I'm mentally handicapped. Every character seems unable to help themselves from verbally describing what's going on or their surface level thoughts, and the plots are laughably thin and hilariously uninteresting.  Even just taking yesterday's episode as an example, it was clumsy and just dull. I'd have been fine with \"big businessman covers up freaky shit\". I'd have been fine with the horribly inaccurate science being paraded around like it was correct. But it's just so shittily done. It's rubbing it in my face that it thinks big businesses are stupid, gun owners are retarded, and that littering is going to kill everything.

Killing the spider is bad but letting it slowly suffocate under its weight is better? Wait what? What happened to all the other spiders in the city?

While this is all a great viewpoint into how a segment of millennials think and act; to say Ford was less believable in her testimony than BK is utterly ridiculous.

Not trying to be a dick, just pointing out that your statements are purely emotional.\n",
      "5. \t\t\t\tThey’re not purely emotional. You can’t aggregate these things into empirical data, which I don’t ignore. There’s a bridge between that exists, even tho it isn’t qualitative to actual numbers. We have a president, who knows as much evidence as I know about the case, publicly decrying her. So it goes both ways in assuming she’s either 100% true or 100% lying.   I’m striking the balance. Part of judging is weight the facts and testimony. I’m saying she was more believable based on comparing the two’s testimony. There’s so much evidence suppressed by the WH and they absolutely continue to handcuff the investigation.   And based on SHEER character, BK was belligerent and very wayward. His deflection tactics were embossed by his disgust at being questioned. His inability to cop to things he shouldn’t be lying about (his drinking habits). The fact that even in his own calendar, he marked out a date that listed him hanging out with the very people Ford said we’re witnesses to what she claims.  People have been put away for less circumstantial evidence.  And again, I think, even in conjecture alone, a testimony like what BK gave would never be believed if he were the one presiding and judging over. No lawyer would ever coach a witness like that. Let alone a judge who knows exactly what to look for. (Source: family of lawyers, many of whom lean right).  And again, I think overall we live in a society of victim blaming for many things, not just rape. To designate it a culture is a step to far. But there’s a good enough segment of Americans who either say it wasn’t a big deal, say it wasn’t true (without even knowing) or if both are true, it’s something everyone has done.  These all employ tactics to remove the blame from the accused, and to minimize the claims of the victim.  Now tell me how any of this is emotionally based?\n",
